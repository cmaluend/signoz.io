OpenTelemetry has emerged as the open standard for instrumenting applications to generate telemetry data like logs, metrics, and traces. 
It is incubated unser the CNCF, the same foundation that incubated Kubernetes. Primarily, designed for universal data collection, it remains **backend-agnostic**, leaving storage and
visualization to your chosen observability platform.

APM stands for Application Performance Management/ Monitoring. APM helps teams effectively monitor their applications by monitoring key metrics for application performance. 
But setting up a robust monitoring and observability stack is challenging in modern, distributed applications. The first step for setting up observability is to instrument your applications for generating telemetry data
which can ve achieved with OpenTelemetry. Let’s learn more about OpenTelemetry.


## What is OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry is an open-source collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs that aims to standardize the way we generate and collect telemetry data. It follows a specification-driven development. The <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry specification</a> has design and implementation guidelines for how the instrumentation libraries should be implemented.
In addition, it provides client libraries in all the major programming languages which follow the specification.

OpenTelemetry was formed after the merger of two open-source projects - OpenCensus and OpenTracing in 2019. Since then, it has been the go-to open-source standard for instrumenting cloud-native applications.

The specification is designed into distinct types of telemetry known as signals. Presently, OpenTelemetry has specifications for these three signals:

- Logs
- Metrics
- Traces

Together these three signals form the [three pillars of observability](https://signoz.io/blog/three-pillars-of-observability/). The application code is instrumented using OpenTelemetry client libraries, which enables the generation of telemetry data. Once the telemetry data is generated and collected, OpenTelemetry needs a backend analysis tool to which it can send the data.

OpenTelemetry can send to multiple backends. You can use different backends for each signal in OpenTelemetry. But managing different tools for **instrumentation** is not recommended. Engineering teams also need to correlate all signals for effective analysis. That’s where an APM tool is needed.

## Things to keep in mind while choosing an OpenTelemetry APM

When chosing an OpenTelemetry APM, it's wise to keep a few pointers in mind:

- First, your APM must **fully support all three of OpenTelemetry's signals** like logs, metrics, and traces. A good observability framework
  requires all three, and the APM should not only ingest and visualize them but also provide features to *easily correlate them* for a
  unified view of application performance.

-  Second, look for **native support for OpenTelemetry semantic conventions**. These standardized attributes (key-value pairs) define the
  components of your distributed system. For example,  let's consider an application that makes a call to a PostgreSQL database. 
  A trace generated with OpenTelemetry would include standardized attributes to describe this operation, such as:

      - "db.system": "postgresql"
      - "db.statement": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123"
      - "net.peer.name": "user-db.prod.internal"
      - "db.operation": "SELECT"

  While many vendors transform this data into proprietary formats, an APM that natively supports these 
  conventions can fully leverage the rich, detailed context that OpenTelemetry provides, which is often lost in
  translation. This also lets us directly search, filter, and create alerts using the official OpenTelemetry attribute names.


- Finally, the **ability to run aggregates on trace data** is critical for creating service-centric insights. By combining aggregation with
  custom tags, your team can create powerful queries to isolate performance issues. For example, you could easily surface the error
  rate and 99th percentile latency for a specific customer segment (e.g., user_status: active) or a new deployment
  (deployment_version: v2).

In a market where most SaaS APMs claim OpenTelemetry compatibility, it's crucial to look deeper. Many of these are legacy platforms
that struggle to move away from proprietary data models, preventing you from realizing the full benefits of OpenTelemetry's rich
conventions. A solution **built natively for OpenTelemetry**, however, is architected from the start to embrace these standards. This is
where SigNoz comes in, offering a powerful choice for teams committed to a genuine OpenTelemetry-first approach.
