Contributing to open-source can be overwhelming at first, and it’s okay to feel a little lost when trying to navigate your way through it. OpenTelemetry is one such open-source project under the CNCF (the second-largest, to be precise).

With over 200 contributors, it’s doing really well and is growing fast. I’ve been part of the community (and advocating its adoption!) for a while and see many people who wish to contribute to the project asking for tips, guidance, and direction in the Slack channels. There isn’t a lack of resources in this aspect, but it could be a bit scattered across a dozen different repos and docs. This blog is an attempt to bring all the resources you need to get started in one place, in a capsule.

I’ve been following [Diana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diana-todea-b2a79968/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_feed%3BcmDxyM3CSomEXgWtZHCWRg%3D%3D) Todea’s journey very closely for a while, and recently she won the OpenTelemetry Community Awards at KubeCon, NA 2025. So my obvious next step was to hop on a call with her and gather as many insights as I could! Between our conversation and her own [recent writings,](https://medium.com/@dianatodea/the-unofficial-guide-to-contributing-to-opentelemetry-where-to-look-and-who-to-talk-to-9de04ae75fe0) I’ve distilled the best insights on how you can move from a lurker to a contributor.

I am also addressing a problem here: While many folks want to contribute, there is a shortage of folks who actually make it to their first PR, and even fewer who consistently continue to contribute and stay active. I’m writing this to address both hurdles, helping you get started and find a reason to stay.

So, if you’ve been waiting for a sign to start or restart, this is it. 💖 ✨

## #1.  What’s the first step I should take?

Kudos to you for taking the first leap. You can start by joining the [CNCF Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/ssb/redirect) channel (of which OTel is a part of) and come say hi in the #hallway channel. Here are some examples.

You can also follow suit and introduce yourself. Next, since contribution is the primary goal, here’s the [official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/contributing/) outlining key aspects you should know. The next step you could take is try finding a good first issue from this [list](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/issues?q=is:issue&#43;is%3Aopen&%2343;sort%3Aupdated-desc&%2343;label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

But now you could run into your first dilemma. Let’s see how to get over it.

Mention channels that you can be a part of 

## #2.  I can’t find a good first issue, wtd?

Finding a good first issue is indeed a task in its own. Most of them could already have been picked up by someone, and there could be active discussions around them. Because these issues are beginner-friendly, they are highly competitive and often claimed within hours of posting. 

<Figure 
  src="/img/blog/2026/01/good-first-issues.webp" 
  alt="Most of the “good first issues” are already assigned" 
  caption="Most of the “good first issues” are already assigned" 
/>

If this is the case, you can shift your strategy. While these issues are great for a quick win, they rarely help you build the rapport/ relationships or architectural understanding necessary for long-term contribution. This is why the Special Interest Group (SIG) model of OpenTelemetry Community is so important. 

You can always start small, by being an active part of the community, including SIG calls and discussions in the corresponding channels, and by trying to make yourself useful with ad hoc tasks.

## #3.  I made a PR, not getting any reviews, wtd?

Give it some time. 

Most maintainers have a day job in addition to maintaining the project, so small delays can occur. You can always post a message in the corresponding Slack channel with enough context so that anyone can pick up the review task. Here’s an example.

  src="/img/blog/2026/01/cncf-slack-pr-review.webp" 
  alt="A message in the Slack channel asking for a review" 
  caption="A message in the Slack channel asking for a review"

## #4.  I want to contribute, but non-technically, wtd?

The good news is you are in high demand! 

There’s a lot of work that is not coding that could use a lot more hands on deck. Some means of contribution include documentation and blogs. You can find ways to improvise existing documentation or add new ones.
You can also join the End User Working Group [EUWG]. They are constantly looking for people to share implementation stories, conduct user interviews, or improve feedback loops between vendors and users. The Merge Forward is another initiative, which focuses on diversity and inclusion, needs allies to help run mentorship programs and community events. 

If you’re the kind of person who likes helping others you can contribute by simply being active in forums or Slack to answer questions from newer users. Helping troubleshoot issues or explaining concepts in the Slack channels or GitHub discussions is a valuable form of contribution too. So, by being a friendly helper in the community, you’re contributing to the project’s success and you might build a reputation for yourself along the way.

If you’re interested in the process side of things, OpenTelemetry being a pretty huge project has many SIG meetings, public notes, and release planning. You could volunteer to help with note-taking in a SIG meeting, or assist in organising community events like the OpenTelemetry Community Day at KubeCon. The [Contributor Experience SIG](https://www.notion.so/6-Things-I-Learned-about-Contributing-to-OpenTelemetry-Actively-2e9fcc6bcd1980dfb2a8cb1902f58745?pvs=21) focuses on making the project better for contributors, they might have initiatives you can join even if you’re not contributing via code.

Another good news is  that you can always switch tracks or do both code and non-code contributions**.** In our call**,** Diana emphasised that a contributor’s journey can be very fluid, you might start with documentation because that’s what you’re comfortable with, and later move into code as you learn more, or vice-versa. The path you choose initially doesn’t lock you in, all contributions count, and in a project as broad as OpenTelemetry, there is a need for a diverse set of skills, which can be the best launchpad for you [if you utilise them well!]. 

## #5.  How to contribute actively and remain consistent?

Here’s  something more harder than getting your first PR merged. Staying consistent and active in the community. Many, many people drop-off after a couple of contributions. Here’s when consistency and discipline come into picture, much like hitting the gym 😅.

Consistency in open source comes from aligning your contributions with what genuinely excites you. You have options to choose ranging from whether it’s a SIG you’re passionate about or a specific skill you want to grow. Set a realistic routine, like contributing weekly or monthly, and stay connected by attending SIG meetings, tracking GitHub updates, or generally staying active in Slack. 

You can keep yourself in the loop by attending the bi-weekly SIG meetings for your area even if just as a listener at first or join community calls.

As Diana puts it, when something triggers you and helps you learn, it becomes easier to show up consistently and enjoy the journey. And like everything else in life, motivation is intrinsic and should come from within you. 🧘‍♀️

## #6.  Ok, but what do I get out of this?

Trick question.

Contributing to OpenTelemetry [or any open source project for that matter] is indeed an investment of your time and effort. The good news is the ROI can be huge, both personally and professionally. 
Today, OpenTelemetry sits at the forefront of observability. By contributing, you’ll gain a much deeper understanding of how instrumentation, tracing, metrics, etc., work under the hood. As you debug issues or implement features, you’ll inevitably learn a ton about distributed systems, telemetry data, and best practices in cloud-native architectures from the industry’s best people!
You’ll also be interacting with engineers from many companies [since OpenTelemetry has contributors from Lightstep, Google, SigNoz, and dozens of organisations]. These connections can lead to job opportunities or collaborations in the future. Many contributors find that being active in open source opens multiple doors eventually. 

Many people also contribute out of a passion for the technology and the ethos of open source; if you’ve benefited from free software, there’s a gratifying element of paying it forward. That motivation can be very fulfilling in itself.  

## Some areas that could use more help

OpenTelemetry is a broad project with many moving parts, and naturally, some parts of it have more active contributors than others. If you’re looking to really make an impact and perhaps have an easier time finding issues to tackle, it helps to know which areas are currently under-resourced. Based on community insights and what maintainers have pointed out, here are a few areas in need of more contributors:

- [**Documentation Localization](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/contributing/localization/):** As mentioned by Diana, translating docs is a huge need. Some language communities like Japanese and Chinese have been very active in translating OpenTelemetry docs, but others have barely started. If you are fluent in any language besides English, you can make a big difference by contributing to localization efforts.
- **Language SDKs with smaller teams:** OpenTelemetry maintains SDKs for many languages. Some of these especially the most popular languages have large contributor teams, but others could use help. For example, newer or less-common language implementations might only have a couple of maintainers. If you happen to know a language like PHP, Ruby, Erlang, or Rust, those SDKs might appreciate extra contributors to help fix bugs and implement new features to catch up with the latest spec.
- **eBPF Instrumentation [OBI]:** One of the newer frontiers in OpenTelemetry is the eBPF auto-instrumentation a.k.a. OBI. This allows automatic capturing of telemetry data at the kernel level without modifying application code. If you’re interested in low-level programming or Linux kernel tech, the OBI project would love some help!

Being part of the community and taking on responsibilities is as simple as sending an intro message to any SIG or channel you're particularly interested in and asking if you can help out with anything. It can be as easy as the screenshot below! Thanks to the amazing community made even more welcoming by the great people innit!

So go, and make a change!
