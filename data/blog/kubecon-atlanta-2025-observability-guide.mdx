KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America is heading to Atlanta this November 10 to 13, and if you're coming for the observability content, you already know the challenge. There are over 300 sessions, multiple tracks running simultaneously, and somehow you're supposed to figure out which talks are actually worth your time.

We've picked out the observability sessions worth your time. Whether you're deep into OpenTelemetry, building internal platforms, or just trying to make sense of your distributed systems, here's what we think you shouldn't miss. Plus, there's a fun surprise waiting for you at the event.

**First time at KubeCon?** Start with the section below on what to expect and how to navigate the conference.

**Been here before?** Jump straight to OpenTelemetry sessions or check what SigNoz is up to.

## If This Is Your First KubeCon

KubeCon brings together thousands of people working on cloud native technologies. The conference has multiple tracks running simultaneously: keynotes, breakout sessions, lightning talks, maintainer tracks, and co-located events. The venue is large, and you'll walk between different session rooms.

**Co-located events** happen on Monday, November 10, before the main conference starts. These are smaller, more focused events on specific topics. If you have an All-Access pass, you can attend these. Smaller rooms mean better access to speakers and more in-depth discussions.

**The hallway track matters.** Some of the best conversations happen between sessions. Don't try to pack your schedule with back-to-back talks. Leave room to actually talk to people.

**Use the Sched app** at [kccncna2025.sched.com](https://kccncna2025.sched.com/) to build your personal schedule. Sessions fill up fast, especially popular ones, so having a plan helps.

Now, let's get to the sessions.

## Kick Things Off with Observability Day

Before the main conference even starts, there's **Observability Day** on Monday, November 10. It runs from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM and requires an All-Access pass.

This is one of the co-located events, which means smaller rooms, more focused discussions, and way better opportunities for Q&A. Observability Day has grown so much that this year it's split into two tracks, which honestly tells you everything about how central observability has become to cloud native infrastructure.

If you have an All-Access pass, start here. The observability community shows up, maintainers are accessible, and you'll get to dig into topics without the massive crowds of the main conference. Check the full schedule on the [co-located events page](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/co-located-events/cncf-hosted-co-located-schedule/).

### Meet Olly, Get a Mystery Box

Olly is our our dear friend and an Arctic bear.

At KubeCon, Olly will be walking around the conference with **15 mystery boxes** containing exclusive rewards and special discounts. Find Olly, get a box. First come, first served.

**How to find Olly:**

We'll post updates on when and where Olly appears throughout the event. Follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/signozio) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/signozhq) for updates.

### At Booth 1372

We'll have demos running of the SigNoz platform. Drop by to chat about observability, OpenTelemetry, self-hosting, and how to avoid vendor lock-in.

Plus, we've got lots of merch because conference swag matters.

**A bit about us**

We're an open source observability platform with over 24,000 GitHub stars. We bring logs, metrics, and traces into a single pane of glass. The big difference is you own your data. You can self-host it or use our cloud, but either way, no vendor lock-in and no surprise bills.

We also have cloud and managed self-hosting solutions.

If you've ever looked at your observability costs and wondered where it all went wrong, come talk to us.

## Tips for Making the Most of KubeCon

1. **Build buffer time into your schedule.**
   Back-to-back sessions leave no room for conversations or coffee. Space things out.
2. **Co-located events offer focused content.**
   Observability Day and other co-located events have smaller rooms and better Q&A. If you have an All-Access pass, take advantage of it.
3. **Conversations between sessions matter.**
   Don't sprint from room to room. The hallway discussions are where you'll connect with people doing similar work.
4. **Download the Sched app.**
   Build your schedule at [kccncna2025.sched.com](https://kccncna2025.sched.com/). Popular sessions fill up, so plan ahead.
5. **Tuesday evening networking.**
   November 11, 6:15 PM - 7:45 PM in Exhibit Hall B3-B5. Food, drinks, and informal poster sessions. Good place to meet people.
