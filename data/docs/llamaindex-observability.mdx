title: LlamaIndex Observability with SigNoz
description: Enable observability and monitoring in your LlamaIndex application with OpenTelemetry to send traces, logs, and metrics to SigNoz
---

## Overview

This guide walks you through enabling observability and monitoring for your Python-based [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) application and streaming telemetry data to SigNoz Cloud using OpenTelemetry. By the end of this setup, you'll be able to monitor AI-specific operations such as document ingestion, document retrieval, user querying, text generation, and user feedback within LlamaIndex, with detailed spans capturing request durations, node and query inputs, model outputs, retrieval scores, metadata, and intermediate steps throughout the pipeline.

Instrumenting your RAG workflows with telemetry enables full observability across the retrieval and generation pipeline. This is especially valuable when building production-grade developer-facing tools, where insight into model behavior, latency bottlenecks, and retrieval accuracy is essential. With SigNoz, you can trace each user question end-to-end, from prompt to response, and continuously improve performance and reliability.

To get started, check out our example LlamaIndex RAG Q&A bot, complete with OpenTelemetry-based monitoring (via OpenInference). View the full repository [here](https://github.com/SigNoz/llamaindex-rag-opentelemetry-demo).

## Prerequisites

- A Python application using **Python 3.8+**
- LlamaIndex integrated into your app, with document ingestion and query interfaces set up
- Basic understanding of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflows
- SigNoz setup (choose one):
  - [SigNoz Cloud account](https://signoz.io/teams/) with an active ingestion key
  - Self-hosted SigNoz instance
- `pip` installed for managing Python packages
- Internet access to send telemetry data to SigNoz Cloud
- _(Optional but recommended)_ A Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies

## Instrument your LlamaIndex application

To capture detailed telemetry from LlamaIndex without modifying your core application logic, we use [OpenInference](https://arize.com/docs/ax/learn/tracing-concepts/what-is-openinference), a community-driven standard that provides pre-built instrumentation for popular AI frameworks like LlamaIndex, built on top of OpenTelemetry. This allows you to trace your LlamaIndex application with minimal configuration.

Check out detailed instructions on how to set up OpenInference instrumentation in your LlamaIndex application over [here](https://pypi.org/project/openinference-instrumentation-llama-index/).

<TabItem value="No Code" label="No Code(Recommended)" default>

No-code auto-instrumentation is recommended for quick setup with minimal code changes. It's ideal when you want to get observability up and running without modifying your application code and are leveraging standard instrumentor libraries.

**Step 1:** Install the necessary packages in your Python environment.

```bash
pip install \
  opentelemetry-distro \
  opentelemetry-exporter-otlp \
  opentelemetry-instrumentation-httpx \
  opentelemetry-instrumentation-system-metrics \
  llama-index \
  openinference-instrumentation-llama-index
```

**Step 2:** Add Automatic Instrumentation

```bash
opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install
```

**Step 3:** Configure logging level

To ensure logs are properly captured and exported, configure the root logger to emit logs at the INFO level or higher:

```python
import logging

logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.INFO)
```

This sets the minimum log level for the root logger to INFO, which ensures that `logger.info()` calls and higher severity logs (WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) are captured by the OpenTelemetry logging auto-instrumentation and sent to SigNoz.

**Step 4:** Run an example

```python
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="llama-index-trace"):
    response = llm.complete("Hello, world!")
    print(response)
```

> 📌 Note: Ensure that the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is properly defined with your API key before running the code.

**Step 5:** Run your application with auto-instrumentation

```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.name=<service_name>" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<your_ingestion_key>" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp \
OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=otlp \
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp \
OTEL_PYTHON_LOG_CORRELATION=true \
OTEL_PYTHON_LOGGING_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED=true \
opentelemetry-instrument <your_run_command>
```

- **`<service_name>`** is the name of your service
- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your_ingestion_key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- Replace `<your_run_command>` with the actual command you would use to run your application. For example: `python main.py`

Code-based instrumentation gives you fine-grained control over your telemetry configuration. Use this approach when you need to customize resource attributes, sampling strategies, or integrate with existing observability infrastructure.

**Step 1:** Install OpenInference and OpenTelemetry related packages

```bash
pip install openinference-instrumentation-llama-index \
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp \
opentelemetry-sdk \
llama-index
```

**Step 2:** Import the necessary modules in your Python application

```python
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
from openinference.instrumentation.llama_index import LlamaIndexInstrumentor
```

**Step 3:** Set up the OpenTelemetry Tracer Provider to send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud

```python
resource = Resource.create({"service.name": "<service_name>"})
provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)
span_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(
    endpoint="https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443/v1/traces",
    headers={"signoz-ingestion-key": "<your-ingestion-key>"},
)
provider.add_span_processor(BatchSpanProcessor(span_exporter))
```

- **`<service_name>`** is the name of your service
- Set the **`<region>`** to match your SigNoz Cloud [**region**](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace **`<your-ingestion-key>`** with your SigNoz [**ingestion key**](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

<Admonition type="info">
  Using self-hosted SigNoz? Most steps are identical. To adapt this guide, update the endpoint and
  remove the ingestion key header as shown in
  <a href="/docs/ingestion/cloud-vs-self-hosted#cloud-to-self-hosted">Cloud → Self-Hosted</a>.
</Admonition>

**Step 4:** Instrument LlamaIndex using OpenInference and the configured Tracer Provider

Use the `LlamaIndexInstrumentor` from OpenInference to automatically trace LlamaIndex operations with your OpenTelemetry setup:

```python
LlamaIndexInstrumentor().instrument(tracer_provider=provider)
```

> 📌 Important: Place this code at the start of your application logic — before any LlamaIndex functions are called or used — to ensure telemetry is correctly captured.

**Step 5:** Run an example

```python
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="llama-index-trace"):
    response = llm.complete("Hello, world!")
    print(response)
```

> 📌 Note: Ensure that the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is properly defined with your API key before running the code.

Your LlamaIndex commands should now automatically emit traces, spans, and attributes.

Finally, you should be able to view this data in Signoz Cloud under the traces tab:

When you click on a trace ID in SigNoz, you'll see a detailed view of the trace, including all associated spans, along with their events and attributes.
