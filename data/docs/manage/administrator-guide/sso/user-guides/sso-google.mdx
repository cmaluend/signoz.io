title: Single Sign-on Authentication With Google Workspace
---

## Overview

This guide walks you through setting up Google Workspace SSO authentication with SigNoz.

**What you'll accomplish:**

- Configure Google Workspace as an identity provider (IdP) for SigNoz
- Enable your team to access SigNoz using their existing Google Workspace accounts

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Google Workspace account** with Super-Admin access
- **SigNoz account** (Cloud or Self-Hosted) with administrative access
- **Your SigNoz instance URL** (e.g., `https://signoz.example.com`)

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials in Google Cloud

1. Visit the [Google Cloud Console → Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Select or create a **project** for SigNoz
3. Click **Create credentials → OAuth client ID → Web application**
4. Add an **Authorized redirect URI**:
   ```
   https://${SIGNOZ_BASEURL}/api/v1/complete/google
   ```
5. Click **Create** and note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. You'll paste these into SigNoz shortly

### Step 2: Configure SigNoz for Google Authentication

Now you'll configure SigNoz to accept authentication from Google Workspace:

1. **Navigate to SigNoz Settings:**

   - Go to your SigNoz dashboard
   - Click on **Settings** in the left sidebar
   - Navigate to **Organization Settings**
   - Click on **Authenticated Domains**

2. **Add New Domain:**

   - Click **Add a Domain**
   - Enter your company domain (e.g., `example.com` for users with `@example.com` emails)

3. **Enter Configuration Details:**

   ```
   Domain: example.com
   Google Client ID: <client-id-from-google>
   Google Client Secret: <client-secret-from-google>
   ```

   **Where to find these values:**

   - **Domain**: The email domain for users who should use SSO (e.g., `example.com` for users with `@example.com` emails)
   - **Google Client ID**: The Client ID from Google Cloud Console
   - **Google Client Secret**: The Client Secret from Google Cloud Console

4. **Save Configuration:**
   - Click **Save** to apply the Google authentication configuration

### Step 3: Enforce SSO

Back in the domain list, toggle **Enforce SSO**. From now on, all users with the email format `<user>@your-email-domain.com` will be forced to log in through Google.

### Step 4: Test the Setup

Open a private/incognito window and visit your SigNoz URL. You will be redirected to Google for authentication and then back to SigNoz.

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues and solutions:**

- **"Authentication failed" error**: Check that the redirect URI exactly matches `https://${SIGNOZ_BASEURL}/api/v1/complete/google` in Google Cloud
- **Stuck in a login loop**: Ensure **Enforce SSO** is enabled **and** the user's email domain matches the configured authenticated domain
- **Locked out?**: If you're unable to login because of faulty setup, use password authentication by appending `?password=Y` to your login URL: `<your-instance-url>/login?password=Y`

## Next Steps

Once Google Workspace SSO is configured:

- Users with your organization's email domain can sign in without prior invites
- Admins can manage user roles within SigNoz after they sign in
- Consider setting up additional security policies in Google Workspace for enhanced security
