title: Single Sign on (SSO) - Overview
---

SigNoz supports single sign-on (SSO), allowing users to authenticate through an external identity provider (IdP) instead of maintaining SigNoz-specific passwords.

## What’s supported

- **SAML 2.0**: Available on `SigNoz Cloud` and `Enterprise Self-Hosted`
- **OIDC**: Available on `SigNoz Cloud` and `Enterprise Self-Hosted`
- **Google Workspace (OAuth2)**: Available on `Community Edition`, `SigNoz Cloud` and `Enterprise Self-Hosted`

## How SSO works in SigNoz

At a high level, you connect your organization’s email domain to an IdP, and SigNoz defers authentication to that IdP.

1. **Authenticated Domain**: You register a domain like `example.com` under `Settings → Organization Settings → Authenticated Domains`.
2. **Choose Method**: For that domain, select SAML, OIDC, or Google (for Workspace) and provide the IdP details.
3. **Just‑in‑Time access**: Users with emails on that domain can sign in via your IdP without a prior invite. Role assignment can then be managed inside SigNoz by admins.
4. **SP‑initiated**: User goes to SigNoz login page (`<your-instance-url>/login`), enters email, and is redirected to the IdP.
5. **IdP‑initiated**: This is not supported yet.

## Setup at a glance

- Go to `Settings → Organization Settings → Authenticated Domains`
- Add your organization’s email domain (e.g., `example.com`)
- Click **Configure SSO** and choose a method
- Save and test from an incognito window
- Optionally toggle **Enforce SSO** for that domain
- If you encounter any issues, you can temporarily use password authentication by appending `?password=Y` to the login URL, e.g. `<your-instance-url>/login?password=Y`.
