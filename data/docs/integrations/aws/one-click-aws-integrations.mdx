**SigNoz One-Click AWS Integration** automates the collection of metrics and logs from your AWS infrastructure. Using CloudFormation and an intelligent AutoDiscovery agent, it provisions the necessary AWS resources (IAM roles, Firehose streams, CloudWatch subscriptions) to stream telemetry data directly to SigNoz.

This integration eliminates manual configuration for individual services and automatically detects new resources as they are provisioned.

## Supported Integrations

The following AWS services are supported for one-click monitoring:

## Key Capabilities

- **AutoDiscovery**: Automatically detects new AWS services and instances in real-time.
- **Automated Setup**: Deploys all necessary resources (Log Groups, Metric Streams, Firehose) via CloudFormation.
- **Multi-Region & Multi-Account**: Monitor resources across multiple regions and accounts from a single SigNoz instance.
- **Pre-built Dashboards**: Access out-of-the-box dashboards for key services immediately after connection.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **AWS Account Access**: You need permissions to create CloudFormation stacks and IAM roles in your AWS account.
- **SigNoz Cloud Account**: This feature is available for SigNoz Cloud users.

### Step 1: Connect AWS Account

1. In SigNoz, navigate to **Integrations** > **Amazon Web Services**.

2. Select the services you want to monitor (e.g., EC2, RDS, Lambda).
3. **Select the Region** where you want to deploy the integration agent.
4. **Choose Regions to Monitor**: Select all AWS regions you wish to collect data from.
5. Click **Launch CloudFormation Stack**. This will redirect you to the AWS Console with a pre-filled template.

6. In AWS, acknowledge the required capabilities and create the stack. The stack will provision:
   - IAM Roles for permissions
   - Kinesis Firehose streams for data delivery
   - CloudWatch Metric Streams
   - Subscription filters for logs

### Step 2: Verify Connection

Once the CloudFormation stack is deployed:

1. Return to the SigNoz Integrations page.
2. The status will update to **Connected** once data ingestion begins.
3. Dashboards for the selected services will be automatically enabled.

## Managing Integrations

### Adding Regions or Services

To expand monitoring to new regions or services:

1. Go to the **Integrations** page and open the AWS configuration.
2. Select the additional regions or services you wish to monitor.
3. The agent will automatically update the configuration to include these new resources.

/>

### Adding Multiple Accounts

You can connect multiple AWS accounts to a single SigNoz workspace:

1. In the AWS Integrations page, click **Add Account**.
2. Follow the same CloudFormation deployment steps for the new account.
3. Data from all accounts will be aggregated in your dashboards, taggable by `account_id`.

### Uninstallation

To remove the integration:

1. Disable the AWS integration in SigNoz.
2. The agent will clean up the created resources (subscription filters, streams).
3. Manually delete the CloudFormation stack in your AWS Console to remove the agent and IAM roles.

## Architecture

The integration deploys an **AWS Integration Agent** in your chosen region. This agent:
- Scans for selected services across enabled regions.
- Configures CloudWatch Metric Streams to push metrics to SigNoz.
- Sets up CloudWatch Log Subscription Filters to forward logs via Kinesis Firehose.
