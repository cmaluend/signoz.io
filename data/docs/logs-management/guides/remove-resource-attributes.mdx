Resource attributes provide additional contextual information about the source of your logs, such as service name, host details, and process information. You can remove unwanted resource attributes either at the source (Agent/SDK) or at the OpenTelemetry Collector level.

## Why remove Resource Attributes?

- **Reduce Data Volume:** Removing resource attributes can help reduce the volume of data stored in your log storage system.
- **Cost Optimization:** Reducing the amount of data stored can help optimize your storage costs.
- **Improved Query Performance:** Removing resource attributes can improve query performance by reducing the number of unique attribute values.
- **Security/Privacy:** Some attributes may contain sensitive information that shouldn't be exported.

## Removing Resource Attributes at the Collector Level

The OpenTelemetry Collector provides a [Resource Processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/resourceprocessor/README.md) which can be used to delete specific attributes from all incoming data.

### 1. Add Resource Processor

In your [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/opentelemetry-collector/configuration/) configuration file, add a resource processor with delete action to remove specific attributes.

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml {4,5}
processors:
  resource/remove_attributes:
    attributes:
      - key: process.command_line
        action: delete
```

In the example above, the `process.command_line` attribute will be removed from all logs processed by this pipeline.

  Ensure you verify the key name exactly matches the attribute you wish to remove.
</Admonition>

### 2. Add the processor to your pipeline

Ensure it is listed in the `processors` section of your logs pipeline.

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml {5}
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [resource/remove_attributes, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

This configuration will ensure `process.command_line` is removed from all logs processed by this pipeline, regardless of the source SDK.

For more details on configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector, see the [OTel Collector configuration guide](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/opentelemetry-collector/configuration/).

## OpenTelemetry Java (SDK & Agent)

The `otel.resource.disabled.keys` configuration property allows you to filter out specific resource attributes. This is a general SDK configuration property that works for both the **OpenTelemetry Java SDK** and the **OpenTelemetry Java Agent**.

### Using System Properties

You can pass the filter as a system property when starting your application, for example:

```bash
java -javaagent:/path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar \
     -Dotel.resource.disabled.keys=process.command_line \
     -jar myapp.jar
```

This will remove the `process.command_line` attribute from all logs generated by your application.

### Using Environment Variables

You can also use the `OTEL_RESOURCE_DISABLED_KEYS` environment variable:

```bash
export OTEL_RESOURCE_DISABLED_KEYS=process.command_line
java -javaagent:/path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar -jar myapp.jar
```

This will remove the `process.command_line` attribute from all logs generated by your application.

<Admonition type="note">
To disable multiple attributes, provide a comma-separated list of attribute keys, for example:

```bash
export OTEL_RESOURCE_DISABLED_KEYS=process.command_line,process.command_args
```

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning">
  **Limitations:** Certain mandatory resource attributes defined by the OpenTelemetry specification
  (such as `telemetry.sdk.name`, `telemetry.sdk.version`, etc.) cannot be disabled through this
  configuration. Removing these requires a custom agent extension.
</Admonition>

## Other Languages

The OTEL_RESOURCE_DISABLED_KEYS configuration is currently specific to the OpenTelemetry Java SDK and Agent. Other SDKs do not support filtering specific attributes via this environment variable. For these languages, use the [Collector-level approach](#removing-resource-attributes-at-the-collector-level) described above, which works universally for all SDKs.

## Validate

To verify that the resource attributes have been removed:

1. Generate some logs from your application.
2. Go to the **Logs** tab in SigNoz.
3. Select a log line and check the **Resource Attributes** section in the details pane.
4. Confirm that `process.command_line` (or your filtered attribute) is no longer present.
