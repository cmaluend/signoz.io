## Using OpenTelemetry for Logs

SigNoz follows the OpenTelemetry approach for logs, supporting all OpenTelemetry log features while adding optimizations at the collector level. This provides a unified model for all your telemetry data - logs, metrics, and traces.

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced log collection scenarios, you can:

- [Use log pipelines](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/introduction) to preprocess your logs before storage
- Set up [PII scrubbing](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-management/guides/pii-scrubbing) to protect sensitive data
- Implement [drop rules](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-management/guides/drop-logs) to filter unwanted logs
