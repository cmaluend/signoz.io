### Q. I can't see related logs for traces.  
A. Make sure your logs include `trace_id` and `span_id`.

<details>
<summary>Show detailed steps</summary>

* If you are collecting application logs from file, ensure you emit the `trace_id` and `span_id` to those logs.
* Once you have `trace_id` and `span_id` in your logs, parse them using the pipelines trace parser. See documentation [here](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/guides/trace/).

</details>

### Q. I want to extract trace_id and span_id from my log line  
A. You can extract these using the logs pipelines trace parser. See documentation [here](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/guides/trace/).

### Q. I want to extract an attribute from my log line  
A. Use Logs Pipeline to parse and extract attributes.

<details>
<summary>Show detailed steps</summary>

The best way to do this is using Logs Pipeline. Refer to:  
- [Logs Pipeline Introduction](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/introduction/)  
- [Parse JSON logs with Pipelines](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/guides/json/)

### Q. How to filter logs of same application/service from different hosts?
A. You can identify them by adding a resource attribute.

<details>
<summary>Show detailed steps</summary>

If you have a application/service which is emitting similar kind of logs but there are multiple instances of it running on different
hosts you can identify them by adding a resource attribute.

There are different ways to add a resource attribute.

1. By passing it as an environment variable if you are using the opentelemetry SDK or auto-instrumentation
    ```
    OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name>,host.name=<host_name>
    ```
    Replace the value of `<service_name>` with the actual service name and `<host_name>` with the actual hostname
2. If you have a otel collector running on each host you can add a processor to add the hostname.
    ```yaml
    processors:
        resource/add_hostname:
            attributes:
                - key: host.name
                  value: <host_name>
                  action: upsert
    ...
    service:
        logs:
            processors: [resource/add_hostname, batch]
    ```
    replace the value of `<host_name>` with the actual hostname

### Q. I am sending logs but my logs are not visible on SigNoz  
A. Check your exporter and collector configuration.

<details>
<summary>Show detailed troubleshooting steps</summary>

- Add a console exporter at the application level (if using SDK) or at the local collector level.
- If the issue persists, reach out to us via chatbox at the bottom right corner of your SigNoz Cloud interface.

</details>

### Q. How to increase the retention period of logs from x days to y days?  
A. If you are using SigNoz Cloud, contact SigNoz support via the chatbox. Or if you are self-hosting, you can change the retention period in the SigNoz UI under Settings > Logs Retention.

### Q. In java my mdc attributes are not visible in SigNoz
A. Ensure your logging configuration includes MDC pattern and OpenTelemetry is configured to capture MDC attributes.

<details>
<summary>Show detailed configuration steps</summary>

You can get your mdc attributes by using the [appender settings][def] and passing it as `-D<property>=<value>` format.

For example, for **logback** use:
`otel.instrumentation.logback-appender.experimental.capture-mdc-attributes=*`
For **log4j** use:
`otel.instrumentation.log4j-appender.experimental.capture-mdc-attributes=*`
See [this documentation][def] for more system properties.

### Q. My log queries are running slowly or taking several minutes to complete. How can I optimize performance?
A. There are several strategies to improve log query performance significantly.

<details>
<summary>Show performance optimization strategies</summary>

#### 1. Use Resource Attributes in Filters

Moving commonly used attributes from regular attributes to resource attributes can drastically improve search performance. For example, if you're filtering by `app`, move it from `attributes.app` to `resource.app` using the [move operator](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/processors/#move) in log pipelines.

#### 2. Enable Data Flattening and Indexing

For nested attributes like `body.step.<any attribute>`, you'll need to:

* Enable data flattening first
* Request indexing of commonly used attributes
* This allows nested fields to exist as their own attributes outside of the body, making queries more performant

#### 3. Reduce Query Time Range

Limiting the time range of your query can significantly improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be searched.

#### Implementation Steps

To optimize your log queries:

1. Identify commonly used filter attributes in your queries
2. Use log pipelines to move these attributes to resource attributes using the move operator
3. If you need to query nested attributes, enable flattening and request indexing for those specific fields
4. Adjust your query time ranges to be as narrow as possible while still capturing the data you need

These optimizations work together to reduce query execution time from minutes to seconds, making your log analysis much more efficient.
