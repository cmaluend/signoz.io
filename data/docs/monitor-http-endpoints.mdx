## Overview

When your website, API, or internal service goes down, you want to know before your users do. This guide shows you how to set up lightweight synthetic monitoring for your HTTP endpoints in SigNoz — giving you uptime/ping monitoring, response time tracking, and error detection for any HTTP(S) URL.

**What you'll achieve:**
- Periodically check if your HTTP endpoints are reachable and returning expected responses
- Visualize endpoint health and response times in SigNoz dashboards
- Set up alerts that notify you when an endpoint goes down
- Optionally track SSL/TLS certificate expiry

This works by using the OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collector — a lightweight agent that runs alongside your infrastructure. The Collector's HTTP Check Receiver makes periodic HTTP requests to your endpoints on a schedule and sends the results as metrics to SigNoz.

<KeyPointCallout title="Using self-hosted SigNoz?" defaultCollapsed={true}>
Most steps are identical. To adapt this guide, update the endpoint and remove the ingestion key header as shown in [Cloud → Self-Hosted](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/cloud-vs-self-hosted/#cloud-to-self-hosted).
</KeyPointCallout>

## Prerequisites

- **A server or VM** to run the OpenTelemetry Collector (this is where the checks run from)
- **Network access** from the Collector host to the endpoints you want to monitor

## Setup

### Step 1: Install the OpenTelemetry Collector

The OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collector is an agent that collects, processes, and exports telemetry data. In this case, it will periodically ping your HTTP endpoints and send the results to SigNoz.

Install the OTel Collector on your server by following the [Collector installation guide](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/get-started/). The guide covers setup for Docker, Kubernetes, VM, and AWS ECS environments.

### Step 2: Add the HTTP Check Receiver

The HTTP Check Receiver is a component that performs synthetic checks — it makes HTTP requests to your endpoints on a schedule and records whether they respond successfully.

Add the following to the `receivers` section of your OTel Collector configuration file (see [where to find your config file](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/opentelemetry-collector/configuration/)):

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
receivers:
  httpcheck:
    targets:
      - endpoint: https://<your-endpoint>
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 60s
```

- `<your-endpoint>`: The URL you want to monitor (for example, `https://api.example.com/health` or `https://yoursite.com`)
- `collection_interval`: How often to check. Default is `60s`. Use shorter intervals (for example, `30s`) for critical endpoints
- `method`: The HTTP method to use. `GET` is most common for health checks

### Step 3: Add the SigNoz Exporter (if not already configured)

If you followed the [Collector installation guide](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/get-started/), the SigNoz exporter is already configured — skip to Step 4.

Otherwise, add the SigNoz OTLP exporter to the `exporters` section of your config:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<your-ingestion-key>"
```

- `<region>`: Your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- `<your-ingestion-key>`: Your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

### Step 4: Enable the HTTP Check in the Pipeline

In the `service.pipelines.metrics` section, add `httpcheck` to the list of receivers. Pipelines connect receivers, processors, and exporters — learn more in the [service pipeline documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/opentelemetry-collector/configuration/#5-service).

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml {3}
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, httpcheck]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

<Admonition type="warning">
Append `httpcheck` to your existing receivers list, do not replace your existing configuration. If you already have other receivers configured, keep them.
</Admonition>

### Step 5: Restart the Collector

Apply the changes by restarting the OTel Collector. The restart command depends on how you deployed the Collector — refer to the environment-specific instructions in the [Collector installation guide](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/get-started/).

## Validate

After restarting, wait for at least one `collection_interval` (default: 60 seconds) and then verify the data is flowing:

1. Go to your **SigNoz Cloud** dashboard
2. Navigate to **Dashboards** → **New Dashboard** → **New Panel**
3. In the **Query Builder**, search for `httpcheck` in the metric dropdown
4. You should see metrics like `httpcheck.status`, `httpcheck.duration`, and `httpcheck.error`

If you see these metrics, your HTTP endpoint monitoring is working.

## Enable Optional Metrics

By default, the HTTP Check Receiver reports three metrics: `httpcheck.status`, `httpcheck.duration`, and `httpcheck.error`. You can enable additional metrics for deeper monitoring.

### SSL/TLS Certificate Expiry

Track when your HTTPS certificates are about to expire — useful for avoiding unexpected downtime from expired certificates:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
receivers:
  httpcheck:
    metrics:
      httpcheck.tls.cert_remaining:
        enabled: true
    targets:
      - endpoint: https://yoursite.com
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 3600s
```

The `httpcheck.tls.cert_remaining` metric reports the number of seconds until the certificate expires. A negative value means the certificate has already expired. You can set up an alert on this metric to get notified days before expiry.

### Response Timing Breakdown

For performance monitoring, enable detailed timing metrics to see where time is spent during the request:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
receivers:
  httpcheck:
    metrics:
      httpcheck.dns.lookup.duration:
        enabled: true
      httpcheck.client.connection.duration:
        enabled: true
      httpcheck.tls.handshake.duration:
        enabled: true
      httpcheck.client.request.duration:
        enabled: true
      httpcheck.response.duration:
        enabled: true
    targets:
      - endpoint: https://yoursite.com
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 60s
```

These metrics help identify whether slow responses are caused by DNS resolution, connection setup, TLS handshake, or server processing.

## Monitor Multiple Endpoints
</ToggleHeading>

You can add multiple endpoints under the `targets` list:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
receivers:
  httpcheck:
    targets:
      - endpoint: https://api.example.com/health
        method: GET
      - endpoint: https://yoursite.com
        method: GET
      - endpoint: https://internal-service.local:8080/ping
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 60s
```

### Use Different Check Intervals

If some endpoints are more critical than others, create separate receiver instances with different intervals. Use the format `httpcheck/<name>` for additional instances:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
receivers:
  httpcheck/critical:
    targets:
      - endpoint: https://api.example.com/health
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 30s

  httpcheck/standard:
    targets:
      - endpoint: https://blog.example.com
        method: GET
      - endpoint: https://docs.example.com
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 300s
```

Then include all instances in your pipeline:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, httpcheck/critical, httpcheck/standard]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

<Admonition type="info">
The receiver name format must use a forward slash: `httpcheck/critical`. Writing `httpcheckcritical` (without the slash) causes a configuration error.

## Create a Dashboard in SigNoz
</ToggleHeading>

Once metrics are flowing, create a dashboard to visualize endpoint health:

### Step 1: Create a New Dashboard Panel

1. In SigNoz, go to **Dashboards** → **New Dashboard**
2. Click **New Panel** and select **Time Series** as the chart type

<Figure src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/time-series-chart.webp" alt="Selecting the time series chart type when creating a new dashboard panel in SigNoz" caption="Select Time Series chart type for HTTP monitoring" />

### Step 2: Configure the Query

1. In the **Query Builder**, search for `httpcheck.status`
2. Add a **WHERE** clause: `http.status_class = 2xx` to filter for successful responses
3. Set **Avg By** to `http.url` to see each endpoint separately

<Figure src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/configure-query.webp" alt="Configuring the httpcheck.status metric query with WHERE clause for 2xx status class" caption="Configure the httpcheck.status query with a WHERE clause for 2xx responses" />

### Step 3: Interpret the Chart

The chart shows:
- **Value of 1**: Endpoint is healthy (returning 2xx responses)
- **Value of 0**: Endpoint is down or returning errors
- **A separate line for each endpoint** when grouped by `http.url`

<Figure src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/endpoint-health-chart.webp" alt="HTTP endpoint health visualization showing status over time with 1 for healthy and 0 for down" caption="HTTP endpoint health visualization — 1 means healthy, 0 means down" />

## Set Up Alerts
</ToggleHeading>

Get notified when an endpoint goes down by creating an alert:

### Step 1: Create an Alert from the Dashboard

1. In your dashboard panel showing endpoint health, click the **dropdown menu** (⋮)
2. Select **Create Alerts**

<Figure src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/create-alert-dropdown.webp" alt="Creating an alert from the dashboard panel dropdown menu" caption="Create an alert directly from a dashboard panel" />

### Step 2: Configure Alert Conditions

Set the alert to fire when an endpoint stops returning 2xx responses:

<Figure src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/alert-configuration.webp" alt="Alert configuration page showing conditions for HTTP endpoint monitoring" caption="Alert configuration — fires when an endpoint goes down" />

Example alert configuration:

```
Metric: httpcheck.status
WHERE: http.status_class = 2xx
Avg By: http.url

Condition: below the threshold at least once during the last 5 mins
Threshold: 1
```

This alert fires when any monitored endpoint fails to respond with a 2xx (success) status code even once during a 5-minute window. You can configure the alert to send notifications to Slack, PagerDuty, email, or other [notification channels](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/notification-channel/).

## Troubleshooting
</ToggleHeading>

### No `httpcheck` metrics appear in SigNoz

**Symptoms:** You configured the receiver but see no `httpcheck.*` metrics in the Query Builder.

**Likely causes and fixes:**

1. **Receiver not added to the pipeline** — Make sure `httpcheck` is listed under `service.pipelines.metrics.receivers` in your config file.
2. **Config file not loaded** — Verify you are pointing to the correct config file when starting the Collector. Check the Collector startup logs for configuration errors.
3. **Collector not restarted** — Restart the Collector after making config changes.

### Connection refused or timeout errors in Collector logs

**Symptoms:** Collector logs show errors like `connection refused` or `context deadline exceeded` for the target endpoints.

**Likely causes and fixes:**

1. **Network access** — Ensure the Collector host can reach the target endpoint. Test with `curl <endpoint>` from the same machine.
2. **Firewall rules** — Check that firewalls and security groups allow outbound traffic from the Collector to the target endpoint.
3. **DNS resolution** — If using hostnames, verify DNS resolution works from the Collector host with `nslookup <hostname>`.

### SSL/TLS errors for HTTPS endpoints

**Symptoms:** Collector logs show TLS handshake errors or certificate-related failures.

**Likely causes and fixes:**

1. **Self-signed certificates** — If the target uses a self-signed certificate, add TLS configuration to skip verification (not recommended for production):
   ```yaml
   receivers:
     httpcheck:
       targets:
         - endpoint: https://internal-service.local
           tls:
             insecure_skip_verify: true
   ```
2. **Expired certificates** — The target's certificate may have expired. Verify with `openssl s_client -connect <host>:443`.

### Metrics not reaching SigNoz Cloud

**Symptoms:** Collector shows successful HTTP checks in debug logs, but metrics don't appear in SigNoz.

**Likely causes and fixes:**

1. **Incorrect ingestion key** — Verify the `signoz-ingestion-key` header value in your exporter config. Get your key from [SigNoz Cloud settings](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/).
2. **Wrong region** — Ensure the `<region>` in the endpoint URL matches your SigNoz Cloud region. See [available regions](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint).
3. **Exporter name mismatch** — The exporter name under `exporters` must match what is listed in `service.pipelines.metrics.exporters`.
