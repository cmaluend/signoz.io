---

SigNoz provides a unified OpenTelemetry native solution for monitoring metrics, traces, and logs,
allowing for greater flexibility and control over your data. This guide will walk you through the steps to switch your
existing New Relic setup to SigNoz, covering all essential signals: metrics, traces, and logs.

## Why Switch to SigNoz?

While New Relic is a powerful platform, switching to SigNoz offers several advantages:

- **Open Source**: SigNoz is fully open-source, giving you complete control over your observability stack
- **Native OpenTelemetry Support**: Built from the ground up to support OpenTelemetry, ensuring future-proof observability
- **Single Integrated Platform**: Unified experience for metrics, traces, and logs without switching contexts
- **Self-Hosted Option**: Deploy SigNoz in your own infrastructure for enhanced security and data privacy

Switching from New Relic to SigNoz can result in significant cost savings, especially for organizations with high data volumes or those looking for more predictable pricing. SigNoz offers transparent and competitive pricing, with both open-source and cloud-hosted options.
