description: Switching from LGTM Stack to SigNoz. How to switch metrics, traces, and logs from LGTM Stack to SigNoz.
---

SigNoz provides a unified OpenTelemetry native solution for monitoring metrics, traces, and logs, allowing for greater flexibility and control over your data. This guide will walk you through the steps to switch your existing LGTM stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir) setup to SigNoz, covering all essential signals: metrics, traces, and logs.

## Why Switch to SigNoz?

While the LGTM stack is powerful, switching to SigNoz offers several advantages:

- **Unified Platform**: Instead of managing multiple components, SigNoz provides a single, cohesive platform for all your observability needs
- **Native OpenTelemetry Support**: Built from the ground up to support OpenTelemetry, ensuring future-proof observability
- **Simplified Operations**: Single installation and upgrade process, reducing maintenance complexity
- **Consistent User Experience**: Unified UI for all observability signals without context switching
