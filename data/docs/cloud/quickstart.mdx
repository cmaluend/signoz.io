Want to explore SigNoz without setting up your own app? This quickstart guide walks you through how to spin up a [lightweight OpenTelemetry Demo](https://github.com/SigNoz/opentelemetry-demo-lite) and
start sending logs, metrics, and traces to SigNoz Cloud in minutes.

The OpenTelemetry Demo App is a distributed microservices application with built-in telemetry, making it an ideal environment for exploring observability workflows with SigNoz.

## Prerequisites

- [A SigNoz Cloud account](/teams/)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone the OpenTelemetry Demo App

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SigNoz/opentelemetry-demo-lite.git
cd opentelemetry-demo-lite
```

### Step 2: Start the Demo App

From the root of the `opentelemetry-demo-lite` directory, run:

```bash
OTLP_ENDPOINT=ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443 SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY=<your-ingestion-key> docker compose up -d
```

- `<your-ingestion-key>`: Your SigNoz [ingestion key](/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- `<region>`: Your SigNoz Cloud [region](/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#get-started)

Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in the project root with these values:

```bash
OTLP_ENDPOINT=ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443
SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY=<your-ingestion-key>
```

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Verify the services are running:

```bash
docker compose ps -a
```

</figure>

The application is pre-configured to send telemetry data to SigNoz Cloud automatically.

### Step 4: Verify Telemetry in SigNoz Cloud

1. Navigate to the **Services** tab — you should see a list of services from the demo app
2. Use the **Service Map** to visualize the architecture and request flows
3. Check the **Traces**, **Logs**, and **Metrics** tabs to explore telemetry data

You are now successfully sending data to SigNoz Cloud!

## Troubleshooting
</ToggleHeading>

### Enable collector's debug logging

Edit `otel-collector-config.yaml` and change the log level from `info` to `debug`:

```yaml
service:
  telemetry:
    logs:
      level: debug
```

Restart with rebuild to apply changes:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Check the OTel Collector logs for detailed export information:

```bash
docker compose logs otel-col
```

Look for successful export messages or errors like connection failures and authentication issues.

### Containers not starting

If containers are failing to start, check the logs for the specific service:

```bash
docker compose logs <service-name>
```

Ensure Docker has adequate memory and no port conflicts exist.

### Services not appearing in SigNoz

- Verify your `OTLP_ENDPOINT` and `SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY` are set correctly
- Check network connectivity to the SigNoz endpoint
- Wait 2-3 minutes after starting the demo app (OpenTelemetry buffers data before sending)

## Next Steps

- Set up a [Redis dashboard](/docs/integrations/redis/#connect-redis) to monitor the database used by the demo app
- Explore [Kafka monitoring](/docs/messaging-queues/kafka-overview/) to observe message queues in the demo app
- Use [Infrastructure Monitoring](/docs/infrastructure-monitoring/overview/) to get a unified view of host and container performance
