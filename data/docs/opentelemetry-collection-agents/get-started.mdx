description: Overview of SigNoz collection agents for deploying and managing OpenTelemetry Collectors.

Collection agents simplify the deployment and management of OpenTelemetry Collectors in your infrastructure. They gather telemetry data like metrics, traces, and logs from your applications and systems, then send it to SigNoz.

## Choose your environment

Select your infrastructure to see the available collection agents and installation guides.

## Why use Collection Agents?

Collection agents use [OpenTelemetry Collectors](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/opentelemetry-collector/configuration) but remove the complexity of manual configuration. Instead of building setups from scratch, you get pre-configured settings tailored for specific environments.

Each collection agent is essentially an OpenTelemetry Collector bundled with:

- **Platform-specific installation**: Detailed guides for deploying in your environment.
- **Pre-configured pipelines**: Ready-to-use receivers, processors, and exporters.
- **Optimized settings**: Configurations tuned for platforms like Kubernetes, ECS, and Fargate.
