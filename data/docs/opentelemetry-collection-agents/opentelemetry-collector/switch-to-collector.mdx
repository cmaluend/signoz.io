This guide shows you how to switch from sending telemetry data directly from your application to SigNoz to routing it through an OpenTelemetry Collector.

<KeyPointCallout title="Using self-hosted SigNoz?" defaultCollapsed={true}>
Most steps are identical. To adapt this guide, update the endpoint and remove the ingestion key header as shown in [Cloud → Self-Hosted](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/cloud-vs-self-hosted/#quick-differences).
</KeyPointCallout>

## Prerequisites

- Your application is already instrumented with OpenTelemetry and sending data to SigNoz
- Access to modify your application's environment variables or configuration
- An OpenTelemetry Collector deployed in your environment — see [get started with collection agents](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/get-started/)

Not sure if you need a Collector? See [Why use the OpenTelemetry Collector?](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/opentelemetry-collector/why-to-use-collector/)

## Step 1. Configure the Collector to forward to SigNoz

Update your Collector's configuration file to forward data to SigNoz.

Please follow the [configuration guide](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/opentelemetry-collector/configuration/) to configure your OpenTelemetry Collector. You will need to update the `endpoint` with your [Ingestion Endpoint](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint) and add your [Ingestion Key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/) to the `headers`.

## Step 2. Update your application environment variables

Update your application to send to the Collector instead of directly to SigNoz:

**Before (direct to SigNoz Cloud):**
```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<your-ingestion-key>"
```

**After (via Collector):**
```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4318"
# Remove the ingestion key - the Collector handles it now
unset OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS
```

<Admonition type="info">
If your Collector runs on a different host, replace `localhost` with the Collector's hostname or IP. For Kubernetes, use the Service name (e.g., `http://otel-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4318`).
</Admonition>

## Step 3. Restart and validate

1. Restart your application with the updated configuration.
2. Check the Collector logs to verify it's receiving and exporting data.
3. In SigNoz, navigate to **Traces** or **Metrics** and verify new data is appearing.

## Troubleshooting

</ToggleHeading>

### No data appears in SigNoz after switching

**Verify Collector is receiving data:**

Add a debug exporter to see data flowing through:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
exporters:
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed
  otlphttp:
    endpoint: https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443
    headers:
      signoz-ingestion-key: <your-ingestion-key>

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug, otlphttp]
```

Check logs for data. If you see spans/metrics in debug output but not in SigNoz, the issue is with the exporter configuration.

**Verify application is sending to Collector:**

```bash
echo $OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
# Should output: http://localhost:4318 (or your Collector host)
```

### Application can't connect to Collector

**Check Collector is listening:**

```bash
netstat -tuln | grep -E '4317|4318'
```

Should show ports 4317 and 4318 in LISTEN state.

**For Kubernetes:**

Verify the Service endpoints:

```bash
kubectl get svc otel-collector -n observability
kubectl get endpoints otel-collector -n observability
```

## Next steps

Now that data flows through the Collector, you can add processors for:

- **Filtering** — Drop health checks or debug data. See [drop spans](https://signoz.io/docs/traces-management/guides/drop-spans/), [drop logs](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-management/guides/drop-logs/), [drop metrics](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/drop-metrics/)
- **PII scrubbing** — Remove sensitive data. See [PII scrubbing for logs](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-management/guides/pii-scrubbing/) and [traces](https://signoz.io/docs/traces-management/guides/pii-scrubbing/)
- **Enrichment** — Add resource attributes. See [resource detection processor](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-management/guides/set-resource-attributes-for-logs/#using-resource-detection-processor)
- **Advanced configuration** — Explore all options in the [Collector configuration guide](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/opentelemetry-collector/configuration/)
