This guide explains how to monitor Kubernetes clusters using OpenTelemetry collectors through SigNoz's `k8s-infra` collection agent and gain full observability into your Kubernetes infrastructure.

## What is Kubernetes Monitoring with OpenTelemetry?

Kubernetes monitoring involves collecting metrics, logs, and traces from your K8s cluster using OpenTelemetry collectors. The `k8s-infra` collection agent simplifies OpenTelemetry Collectors deployment by providing pre-configured collectors that automatically discover and monitor all Kubernetes resources.

To learn more about the k8s-infra collection agent architecture, components, and how it works, see the [K8s-Infra Overview Guide](/docs/collection-agents/k8s/k8s-infra/overview).

## Prerequisites

Before setting up OpenTelemetry monitoring for your Kubernetes cluster, ensure you have:

- A SigNoz backend (SigNoz Cloud or self-hosted) to receive OpenTelemetry data
- kubectl access to your Kubernetes cluster
- Helm v3 installed for deploying the OpenTelemetry collector
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts (pods, nodes, namespaces)

## How OpenTelemetry Kubernetes Monitoring Works

The k8s-infra collection agent deploys OpenTelemetry collectors as a DaemonSet and a Deployment across your Kubernetes cluster:

1. **Install k8s-infra** OpenTelemetry collectors in your K8s cluster
2. **OpenTelemetry collectors** automatically discover Kubernetes resources (pods, nodes, services)
3. **Telemetry data** (metrics, logs, traces) is collected using OpenTelemetry standards
4. **Data forwarding** to SigNoz backend via OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol)
5. **Visualization** and analysis in SigNoz

## Step 1: Install OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes

Deploy the `k8s-infra` Collection agent to your Kubernetes cluster. Follow the complete step-by-step instructions in the [K8s-Infra Installation Guide](/docs/collection-agents/k8s/k8s-infra/install-k8s-infra).

## Step 2: What Telemetry Does the OpenTelemetry Collector Gather?

Once deployed, the k8s-infra collection agent automatically collects:

Node-level and Pod-level telemtry, including:

- **Host Metrics:** CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and network statistics from each node.
- **Kubelet Metrics:** Data from the Kubelet API on each node, such as pod and container resource utilization.
- **Container Logs:** Tailing and parsing logs generated by the containers running on the node.
- **Collect Traces:** Traces from the application will also be collected generated by containers on node.

Cluster metrics and events:

- **Cluster-level Metrics:** Information about Kubernetes objects such as Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, and Jobs.
- **Kubernetes Events:** Significant events within the cluster, useful for troubleshooting and auditing.
- **Custom Metrics:** It can be configured to collect metrics from other services in the cluster, like Redis or PostgreSQL.
- **Prometheus Scraping:** Metrics can also be scraped using pod annotations.

Learn more about what the k8s-infra collection agent monitors in the [K8s-Infra Overview Guide](/docs/collection-agents/k8s/k8s-infra/overview).

## Step 3: Configure Your OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes Monitoring

The k8s-infra collection agent offers extensive configuration options to customize your monitoring setup:

### Available Configuration Options

- **Log collection presets**: Choose between different log parsing and collection strategies
- **Metrics collection settings**: Enable/disable specific metric types and adjust collection intervals
- **Resource filtering**: Control which Kubernetes resources to monitor
- **Data sampling**: Configure trace sampling rates to manage data volume
- **Custom processors**: Add your own OpenTelemetry processors for data transformation
- **Performance tuning**: Adjust batch sizes, timeout values, and resource limits

For detailed information on all available configuration options, including log presets, metrics collection settings, and advanced customizations, see the [K8s-Infra Configuration Guide](/docs/collection-agents/k8s/k8s-infra/configure-k8s-infra).

## Step 4: Monitor Multiple Kubernetes Clusters with OpenTelemetry

To monitor multiple Kubernetes clusters with a single SigNoz backend:

1. **Deploy k8s-infra** in each Kubernetes cluster you want to monitor
2. **Set unique cluster names** using the cluster identification parameter
3. **Point to the same SigNoz endpoint** for centralized observability

The installation guide provides specific instructions for multi-cluster setups. See the [K8s-Infra Installation Guide](/docs/collection-agents/k8s/k8s-infra/install-k8s-infra) for multi-cluster deployment instructions.

## Step 5: Visualize Kubernetes Metrics in SigNoz

After installing the OpenTelemetry collector, view your Kubernetes data in SigNoz:

### Filter by Kubernetes Cluster

- Navigate to **Metrics**, **Logs**, or **Traces** in SigNoz
- Filter by `clusterName` attribute to view specific cluster data
- Use the `k8s.cluster.name` resource attribute for OpenTelemetry standard filtering

### Create Kubernetes Dashboards

- **Per-cluster dashboards**: Monitor individual cluster health and performance
- **Multi-cluster comparison**: Compare metrics across different Kubernetes environments
- **Node-level monitoring**: Track resource usage per node
- **Pod-level insights**: Analyze container performance and failures
