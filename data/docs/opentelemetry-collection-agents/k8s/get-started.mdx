SigNoz provides specialized collection agents to help you monitor your Kubernetes clusters and applications. Depending on your specific needs—whether you need full infrastructure monitoring, application auto-instrumentation, or support for serverless environments—you can choose the agent that best fits your use case.

## Choose your agent

## Which agent should I use?

### K8s Infra (Recommended)
**K8s Infra** is the default choice for most environments. It is based on the standard [OpenTelemetry Collector Helm chart](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/platforms/kubernetes/helm/collector/) but comes pre-configured by SigNoz with best practices for:
- **Logs**: Cluster-level logs from all pods.
- **Metrics**: Node, pod, and container metrics.
- **Traces**: Acts as a gateway for application traces.

Use this for full cluster visibility with minimal setup. To send traces, [instrument your application](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation) and point it to the K8s Infra agent.

### OpenTelemetry Operator
Use the **OpenTelemetry Operator** if you need **auto-instrumentation** (capturing traces without code changes). It injects instrumentation libraries directly into your application pods.

**Recommendation**:
Start with **K8s Infra** for standard cluster monitoring (logs, metrics, and traces). Add the **OpenTelemetry Operator** only if you specifically need auto-instrumentation.

### Serverless (EKS Fargate)
Use the **Serverless agent** for AWS EKS Fargate workloads. Since Fargate abstracts the underlying nodes, this agent runs as a sidecar to collect telemetry.
