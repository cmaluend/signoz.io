id: overview
description: Monitor Serverless Kubernetes workloads on EKS Fargate with an OpenTelemetry Collector in sidecar to send metrics, logs, and traces to SigNoz.
---

EKS Fargate runs Kubernetes pods on serverless compute without exposing the node. As a result, node-level DaemonSets and host mounts are not supported. To collect telemetry from applications on Fargate, deploy an OpenTelemetry Collector as a sidecar container within each pod that you want to observe.

### Why sidecar on Fargate?

- DaemonSets are not supported on Fargate nodes
- HostPath mounts and host network/ports are not available
- The sidecar provides a local OTLP endpoint (localhost) for your app to send traces, metrics, and logs

### What you can collect

- **Kubelet Metrics:** Data from the Kubelet API on each node, such as pod and container resource utilization.
- **Container Logs:** Tailing and parsing logs generated by the containers running on the node.
- **Collect Traces:** Traces from the application will also be collected generated by containers on node.

### High-level architecture

```
Pod (Fargate)
├─ app container(s)
│  └─ sends OTLP telemetry data to the sidecar
└─ otel-collector sidecar
   ├─ receives OTLP data from the app container(s)
   └─ exports telemetry to SigNoz (cloud or self-hosted)
```
