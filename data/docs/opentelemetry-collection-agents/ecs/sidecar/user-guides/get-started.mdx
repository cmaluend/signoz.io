This guide explains how to monitor Amazon ECS Fargate (serverless) using OpenTelemetry and SigNoz. You'll deploy an OpenTelemetry Collector as a sidecar container inside your ECS tasks. Applications send OTLP telemetry to localhost; the sidecar exports to SigNoz.

## What is ECS Fargate Monitoring with OpenTelemetry?

With the Fargate launch type, AWS manages the infrastructure and you cannot run host-level daemons. The OpenTelemetry Collector sidecar runs in the same task as your application and provides:

- Local OTLP endpoints (gRPC/HTTP) for app telemetry
- ECS container/task metrics via the Task Metadata Endpoint
- Optional app log routing via Fluent Bit/FireLens to the sidecar

Learn the concepts in the [ECS Sidecar - Overview](/docs/collection-agents/ecs/sidecar/overview).

## Prerequisites

- SigNoz backend (SigNoz Cloud or self-hosted)
- ECS cluster using Fargate launch type
- AWS CLI with appropriate permissions
- Ability to update task definitions and IAM roles

## How It Works

1. Add an OpenTelemetry Collector container as a sidecar in your ECS task definition
2. Configure the sidecar to receive app OTLP and collect ECS metrics
3. Point your instrumented applications to `http://localhost:4317` (or 4318 for HTTP)
4. Sidecar enriches and forwards telemetry to SigNoz

## Step 1: Install the Sidecar

Add the collector container to your ECS task definition and store configuration in SSM Parameter Store.

- Follow [ECS Sidecar - Install](/docs/collection-agents/ecs/sidecar/install)

## Step 2: Configure the Sidecar and Applications

- Set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` in app containers to the sidecar
- Use `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` with `service.name=<your-service>`
- Optionally configure FireLens/Fluent Bit to send logs to the sidecar

- Follow [ECS Sidecar - Configure](/docs/collection-agents/ecs/sidecar/configure)

## What Data Can You Collect?

- ECS container/task metrics (awsecscontainermetrics)
- Application traces and metrics via OTLP
- Application logs via FireLens/Fluent Bit to `fluentforward` receiver


## Visualize in SigNoz

- Build per-service and per-environment dashboards
- Filter by cluster, service, task, and resource attributes
- Correlate traces and logs for rapid debugging
