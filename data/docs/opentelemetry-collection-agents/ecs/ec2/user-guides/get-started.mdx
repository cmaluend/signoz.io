This guide explains how to monitor Amazon ECS on EC2 using OpenTelemetry and SigNoz. You'll deploy an OpenTelemetry Collector as a daemon service on each EC2 host to collect infrastructure metrics, container logs, and application telemetry.

## What is ECS EC2 Monitoring with OpenTelemetry?

With the EC2 launch type, your tasks run on EC2 instances that you manage. Running the OpenTelemetry Collector as a daemon on each host enables:

- Host and container metrics collection
- Container log tailing and processing
- Receiving OTLP telemetry from your applications
- Forwarding telemetry to SigNoz for analysis and dashboards

Learn the concepts in the [ECS EC2 - Overview](/docs/collection-agents/ecs/ec2/overview).

## Prerequisites

- SigNoz backend (SigNoz Cloud or self-hosted)
- ECS cluster using EC2 launch type
- AWS CLI with appropriate permissions
- Ability to deploy CloudFormation stacks and set SSM Parameter Store values

## How It Works

1. Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector as a daemon service (one per EC2 host)
2. Configure the collector to collect host/container data and receive app OTLP
3. Point your instrumented applications to the daemon service OTLP endpoint
4. Data is enriched and sent to SigNoz

## Step 1: Install the Daemon Service

Use the CloudFormation-based setup to deploy the collector as a daemon across your EC2 hosts.

- Follow [ECS EC2 - Install](/docs/collection-agents/ecs/ec2/install)

## Step 2: Configure the Collector and Applications

- Tune the collector configuration (receivers, processors, exporters)
- Set app `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to the daemon service
- Add `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` with `service.name=<your-service>`

- Follow [ECS EC2 - Configure](/docs/collection-agents/ecs/ec2/configure)

## What Data Can You Collect?

- Host metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- ECS container/task metrics (awsecscontainermetrics)
- Container and application logs (filelog)
- Application traces and custom metrics (OTLP)

## Visualize in SigNoz

- Build dashboards for cluster and service-level views
- Filter by cluster/service/task attributes
- Investigate traces and logs for faster troubleshooting
