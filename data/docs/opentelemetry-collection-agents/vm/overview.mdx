title: VM Collection Agent - Overview
id: overview
description: Monitor virtual machines and applications running on them using OpenTelemetry Collector binary to send metrics, logs, and traces to SigNoz.
doc_type: explanation
---

The VM Collection Agent uses the OpenTelemetry Collector binary to collect telemetry data from applications and infrastructure running on virtual machines. The collector binary runs as an agent on the VM, receiving telemetry from instrumented applications and collecting host metrics from the VM itself.

## How it Works

OpenTelemetry-instrumented applications in a VM can send data to the `otel-binary` agent running in the same VM. The OTel agent then forwards this data to SigNoz.

## What You Can Collect

- **Application Traces:** Distributed traces from OpenTelemetry-instrumented applications
- **Application Metrics:** Custom metrics from your applications
- **Application Logs:** Log data from your applications
- **Host Metrics:** CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and network statistics from the VM
- **Collector Metrics:** Internal metrics from the OpenTelemetry Collector itself

## Installation Methods

The VM Collection Agent supports the following installation methods:

- **Linux:** **DEB** (systemd on Debian/Ubuntu), **RPM** (systemd on Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora), or **Manual** (plain binary from a tarball)
- **macOS:** **Manual** (plain binary from a tarball)
- **Windows:** **MSI** (Windows service) or **Manual** (plain binary)
