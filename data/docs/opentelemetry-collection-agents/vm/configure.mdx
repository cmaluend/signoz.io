---

This guide explains how to configure the OpenTelemetry Collector binary running on your virtual machine to send telemetry data to SigNoz.

## Prerequisites

- OpenTelemetry Collector binary installed (see [Installation guide](/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/vm/install))
- SigNoz Cloud account or self-hosted SigNoz instance
- Access to create and edit the `config.yaml` file

<KeyPointCallout title="Using self-hosted SigNoz?" defaultCollapsed={true}>
Most steps are identical. To adapt this guide, update the endpoint and remove the ingestion key header as shown in [Cloud → Self-Hosted](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/cloud-vs-self-hosted/#cloud-to-self-hosted).
</KeyPointCallout>

## OpenTelemetry Collector Usage

You copy the configuration file to the respective config paths as per your installation methods. Followed by respective instructions to start, restart, and view logs of the `otelcol` binary.

### Systemd

To copy the update the otel-collector configuration with your own `config.yaml` file:

```bash
sudo cp your-config.yaml /etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml
```

To restart `otelcol-contrib` with updated config:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart otelcol-contrib.service
```

To check the status of `otelcol-contrib`:

```bash
sudo systemctl status otelcol-contrib.service
```

To view logs of `otelcol-contrib`:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u otelcol-contrib.service
```

To stop `otelcol-contrib`:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop otelcol-contrib.service
```

### Plain Binary

It is recommended to use the `otelcol-contrib` binary inside the terminal multiplexer tools like `tmux` or `screen`, since plain binary usage is ephemeral.

To copy the updated `config.yaml` file:

```bash
cp your-config.yaml ./otelcol-contrib/config.yaml
```

To change the directory inside the `otelcol-contrib` folder:

```bash
cd otelcol-contrib
```

To view the last 50 lines of `otelcol-contrib` logs:

```bash
tail -f -n 50 otelcol-output.log
```

To stop `otelcol-contrib`:

```bash
kill "$(< otel-pid)"
```
