### Q. How do I separate environments in the Volume breakdown dashboard?

A. Add the `deployment.environment` attribute to your resource metadata in the OpenTelemetry Collector configuration.

If your environments are not appearing separately in the "Volume breakdown by environment" dashboard, you need to add the `deployment.environment` attribute to your resource metadata.

**1. Add the resource processor to your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration:**

```yaml
processors:
  resource:
    attributes:
      - key: deployment.environment
        value: "your-environment-name"
        action: upsert
```

**2. Replace `"your-environment-name"`** with the actual name of your environment (e.g., "dev", "qa", "prod")

**3. Apply this processor to your metrics and logs pipelines** in the collector configuration:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [resource, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [resource, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

**4. Restart your OpenTelemetry Collector** to apply the changes

After implementing this configuration, your environments will appear as separate entries in the Volume breakdown dashboard instead of being grouped together.
