Logs are unstructured data, and it is not easy to analyze them. SigNoz provides easy to use **Regex Parser** to parse unstructured logs and extract information from them using Logs Pipelines.

## Prerequisites

- You are sending logs to SigNoz.
- You have access to the **Logs Pipelines** section in SigNoz UI.

Learn more about SigNoz [Logs Pipelines](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/introduction/).

## About Regex Parser

The Regex processor uses <a href="https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Regular Expressions</a> (based on Go's RE2 syntax) to extract information from unstructured logs. It uses **Named Capture Groups** to map parts of your log message to attribute names.

**The Concept:**

You define a pattern containing groups like `(?P<attribute_name>pattern)`. Whatever matches inside the parentheses becomes the value of `attribute_name`.

## Example Log

Throughout this guide, we'll use the following example of a legacy application log entry:

```text
2025-12-27 10:00:00 [INFO] User 123 logged in from 192.168.1.5
```

## Desired Outcome

After parsing, we want to extract specific information into structured attributes.

| Attribute | Value       |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `level`   | INFO        |
| `user_id` | 123         |
| `ip`      | 192.168.1.5 |

The final processed log should look like this:

```json
{
  "body": "2025-12-27 10:00:00 [INFO] User 123 logged in from 192.168.1.5",
  "attributes": {
    "level": "INFO",
    "user_id": "123",
    "ip": "192.168.1.5"
  }
}
```

## Creating a Pipeline

Before you can parse logs, you need to create a pipeline that will filter and process them.

### Step 1: Navigate to Pipelines Page

In SigNoz, go to **Logs** → **Pipelines**

  alt="Navigate to Log Pipelines"

### Step 2: Create a New Pipeline

- If you do not have existing pipelines, press the **"New Pipeline"** button.

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/logs-management/logs-pipelines/logs-parsing-pipeline-step2.webp"
  alt="New Pipeline Button"
  caption="New Pipeline Button"
/>

- If you already have some pipelines, press the **"Enter Edit Mode"** button and then click the **"Add a New Pipeline"** button at the bottom of the list.

/>

  alt="Add a New Pipeline button"
  caption="Add a New Pipeline button"
/>

### Step 3: Configure the Pipeline

Provide details about the pipeline in the Create Pipeline Dialog:

- **Name:** Provide a descriptive pipeline name.
- **Description:** Add a detailed description for your pipeline (optional).
- **Filter:** Use the filter field to select the logs you want to process. For example, `service.name = my-app` or `log.file.name = app.log`.
- **Filtered Logs Preview:** Verify that the logs you want to process are selected.

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/logs-management/logs-pipelines/regex-parsing-pipeline-step5.webp"
  alt="Create New Pipeline dialog"
  caption="Create New Pipeline dialog"
/>

Press the **"Create"** button to create the pipeline.

## Configuring Regex Parser

Now that we have a pipeline, we will add the Regex Parser processor to extract attributes from our log line.

### Step 1: Add a Processor

Expand your pipeline and click the **"Add Processor"** button.

  alt="Expand Pipeline to access Processors"
  caption="Expand Pipeline to access Processors"
/>

<Figure

  alt="Add Processors Button"
  caption="Add Processors Button"
/>

### Step 2: Configure Regex Parser

We will now configure the processor to parse the log message.

#### Before Parsing

At this stage, your log typically contains the raw message in the `body` field:

```json
{
  "body": "2025-12-27 10:00:00 [INFO] User 123 logged in from 192.168.1.5"
}
```

#### Processor Configuration

Select **Regex Parser** and configure the fields:

- **Name**: `parse_app_log`
- **Parse From**: `body` (This is where the raw message resides)
- **Parse To**: `attributes` (We want to add extracted values directly to log attributes)
- **Pattern**:
  ```regex
  ^.*\[(?P<level>\w+)\].*User (?P<user_id>\d+) logged in from (?P<ip>[\d\.]+)
  ```

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/logs-management/logs-pipelines/regex-parsing-step3.webp"
  alt="Regex Parser Configuration Example"
  caption="Configuring the Regex Parser"
/>

Press **"Create"** to add the processor.

#### After Parsing

Once the processor is applied, the log structure changes. The captured groups from the regex are added as keys in the `attributes` object.

```json
{
  "body": "2025-12-27 10:00:00 [INFO] User 123 logged in from 192.168.1.5",
  "attributes": {
    "level": "INFO",
    "user_id": "123",
    "ip": "192.168.1.5"
  }
}
```

#### Key Observations

- The original `body` remains unchanged.
- New fields `level`, `user_id`, and `ip` are now available in `attributes`, making them queryable in SigNoz.

## Simulate and Validate

Before deploying, use the **Simulate** feature to test your parser:

1. Click the **"eye" icon** in the actions column for the pipeline to open the Pipeline Preview Dialog.

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/logs-management/logs-pipelines/regex-parsing-step4.webp"
  alt="Pipeline with the regex parser"
  caption="Pipeline with the regex parser"
/>

2. Press the **"Simulate Processing"** button to see the output.

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/logs-management/logs-pipelines/regex-parsing-step5.webp"
  alt="Pipeline Preview with Sample Logs"
  caption="Pipeline Preview with Sample Logs"
/>

3. Click the expand button next to processed log line to view the log details.

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/logs-management/logs-pipelines/regex-parsing-step6.webp"
  alt="Pipeline Preview with Processed Logs"
  caption="Pipeline Preview with Processed Logs"
/>

4. Verify that the extracted attributes (`level`, `user_id`, `ip`) appear correctly.

  src="/img/docs/logs-management/logs-pipelines/regex-parsing-step7.webp"
  alt="Logs after Regex Parser"
  caption="Logs after Regex Parser with extracted attributes"
/>

## Deploy the Pipeline

After verifying the simulated logs in Pipeline Preview Dialog, your pipeline is ready.

1. Press the **Save Configuration** button at the bottom of the pipelines list. This will store the latest state of your pipelines and deploy them for pre-processing.

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/logs-management/logs-pipelines/regex-parsing-step8.webp"
  alt="Save Configuration Button"
  caption="Save Configuration Button"
/>

2. You can track the deployment status using the **Change History** tab at the top of pipelines.

## Final Output

Once deployed, your incoming logs will be transformed automatically.

```json
{
  "body": "2025-12-27 10:00:00 [INFO] User 123 logged in from 192.168.1.5",
  "attributes": {
    "level": "INFO",
    "user_id": "123",
    "ip": "192.168.1.5"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

</ToggleHeading>

### Parser not matching any logs

- Use the **Simulate** feature in the pipeline editor to test with real log entries.
- Check that `Parse From` points to the correct field (`body` vs `attributes.message`).
- Test patterns with <a href="https://regex101.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">regex101</a> (select Go flavor).

### Extracted attributes not appearing

- Ensure the pipeline is **deployed** after saving.
- Check pipeline order—parsers should run before processors that modify the same fields.
- Use unique attribute names to avoid conflicts.

### Performance issues with complex patterns

- Replace greedy `.*` with specific patterns like `[^\]]+` where possible to improve performance.
- Add filter conditions to apply parsers only to relevant logs.
