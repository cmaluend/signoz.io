## Step 1: Instrument Your Application

Select your language or framework to add OpenTelemetry instrumentation and start sending traces to SigNoz:

## Step 2: Explore Your Data in SigNoz

Once traces are flowing, use SigNoz to monitor and debug your applications:

### Services View

See all instrumented services with real-time throughput, latency, and error rate metrics. The service dependency map shows how services interact. [Learn more →](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/metrics/)

### Traces Explorer

Filter and search traces by service, operation, status, duration, or any span attribute. Drill into individual traces to see flamegraphs and Gantt charts. [Learn more →](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/traces/)

### APM Dashboards

Pre-built dashboards show p99 latency, error rates, Apdex scores, and throughput based on Traces.
