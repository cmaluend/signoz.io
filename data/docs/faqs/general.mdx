### Q. How to setup SigNoz across different environments?

A. Tag your telemetry with the `deployment.environment` resource attribute (e.g., production/staging/development) via SDK env vars or the Collector’s Resource processor, then filter and alert by environment in SigNoz. If you deploy the SigNoz k8s infra Helm chart, the chart sets `deployment.environment` for you via the required `deploymentEnvironment` value, so you do not need to add it manually—see the [Kubernetes infra install guide](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/k8s/k8s-infra/install-k8s-infra/).

You can ingest data from across your environments and tag your telemetry with the `deployment.environment` resource attribute (for example: `production`, `staging`, `development`). This lets you filter, compare, and alert per environment in the UI.

- SDK (all languages)

  - Set via environment variables when starting your app:
    ```bash
    OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="deployment.environment=production"
    ```

- OpenTelemetry Collector (agent or gateway)
  - Upsert the attribute with the Resource processor so all signals include it:
    ```yaml
    processors:
      resource/env:
        attributes:
          - key: deployment.environment
            value: production
            action: upsert
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          processors: [resource/env, batch]
        metrics:
          processors: [resource/env, batch]
        logs:
          processors: [resource/env, batch]
    ```
  - Refer to [OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration reference](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/opentelemetry-collector/configuration/#resource-processor) for more details on the Resource processor.
  - Guide on setting resource attributes for logs (applies similarly to traces/metrics): [here](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-management/guides/set-resource-attributes-for-logs).

For SigNoz Cloud:

- Retention period changes require assistance from the SigNoz support team.
- Available retention periods:
  - Logs: Up to 180 days
  - Metrics: Up to 13 months
  - Traces: Up to 180 days
- Changes to retention periods may affect pricing. Use the [pricing calculator](https://signoz.io/pricing/#estimate-your-monthly-bill) to estimate updated costs.

To request a retention period change for SigNoz Cloud:

1. Contact SigNoz support with the requested retention periods for each data type (logs, metrics, and/or traces).
2. Review and confirm any pricing changes with the support team.
3. Support will implement the changes, typically within 24 hours.

Note: Retention period changes only affect newly ingested data and will not apply retroactively to existing data.
