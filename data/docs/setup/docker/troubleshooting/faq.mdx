This troubleshooting guide includes step-by-step instructions that should resolve most SigNoz installation issues in Docker.

## Container signoz-init-clickhouse Hangs Forever

After installation, you might sometimes see the `signoz-init-clickhouse` container getting stuck. The logs will show:

```bash
docker logs signoz-init-clickhouse
# Fetching histogram-binary for linux/amd64
# Connecting to github.com (20.205.243.166:443)
```

This indicates the helper binary wasn’t fetched from GitHub. For these issues, restart the SigNoz containers and allow time for the helper binary to download:

```bash
docker compose restart
```
