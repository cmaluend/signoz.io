doc_type: howto
---

## Overview

This guide walks you through forwarding AWS CloudWatch logs to SigNoz using the OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collector's `awscloudwatch` receiver. By the end, you'll have CloudWatch logs flowing into SigNoz where you can search, filter, and correlate them with traces and metrics.

<KeyPointCallout title="What is the OpenTelemetry Collector?" defaultCollapsed="true">
The OpenTelemetry Collector is a vendor-agnostic agent that collects, processes, and exports telemetry data (logs, metrics, traces). In this setup, it pulls logs from CloudWatch and forwards them to SigNoz. Learn more in the [OTel Collector documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/opentelemetry-collector/why-to-use-collector/).
</KeyPointCallout>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **SigNoz account**: A [SigNoz Cloud](https://signoz.io/teams/) account or a running [self-hosted SigNoz instance](https://signoz.io/docs/install/)
- **AWS account**: Access to AWS with permissions to create IAM policies
- **CloudWatch log groups**: At least one log group with logs you want to forward
- **VM or server**: A machine (Linux recommended) where you can run the OTel Collector

## Step 1: Install the OpenTelemetry Collector

First, install the OpenTelemetry Collector on the machine that will pull logs from CloudWatch. Follow the installation guide for your environment: [Install OpenTelemetry Collection Agent](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/get-started/)

<Admonition type="info">
The OTel Collector must have network access to both AWS (to poll CloudWatch) and your SigNoz instance (to export logs).
</Admonition>

## Step 2: Configure AWS credentials

The OTel Collector needs AWS credentials to access CloudWatch. Create or update the credentials file at `~/.aws/credentials` on the machine running the collector:

```bash:~/.aws/credentials
[default]
aws_access_key_id=<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key=<YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

Replace the placeholders:
- `<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>`: Your AWS access key ID
- `<YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>`: Your AWS secret access key

<KeyPointCallout title="Using named profiles?" defaultCollapsed="true">
If you use multiple AWS profiles, you can specify a named profile like this:

```bash:~/.aws/credentials
[my-cloudwatch-profile]
aws_access_key_id=<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key=<YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

Then reference it in your receiver config with `profile: 'my-cloudwatch-profile'` (shown in Step 4).
</KeyPointCallout>

## Step 3: Create the required IAM policy

The AWS credentials you use need permission to read CloudWatch logs. Create an IAM policy with the following permissions and attach it to the user or role associated with your credentials:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "CloudWatchLogsReadAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
                "logs:FilterLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:<REGION>:<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:log-group:*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Replace the placeholders:
- `<REGION>`: Your AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`), or use `*` to allow all regions
- `<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>`: Your 12-digit AWS account ID (find it in the AWS Console under your account dropdown)

<Admonition type="tip">
To restrict access to specific log groups, replace `log-group:*` with `log-group:/your/log/group/name:*`.
</Admonition>

## Step 4: Configure the awscloudwatch receiver

Add the `awscloudwatch` receiver to your OTel Collector configuration file (`config.yaml`). This receiver polls CloudWatch at regular intervals and forwards logs to SigNoz.

Choose one of the following configurations based on your needs:

### Option A: Autodiscover log groups

This configuration automatically discovers and collects logs from log groups matching a prefix:

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  awscloudwatch:
    region: us-east-1
    logs:
      poll_interval: 1m
      groups:
        autodiscover:
          limit: 100
          prefix: /aws/lambda/
```

Configuration breakdown:
- `region`: The AWS region where your log groups are located
- `poll_interval`: How often to check for new logs (e.g., `1m` for every minute, `5m` for every 5 minutes)
- `limit`: Maximum number of log groups to discover (up to 100)
- `prefix`: Only collect log groups whose names start with this prefix (e.g., `/aws/lambda/` for Lambda function logs)

### Option B: Specify log groups by name

This configuration explicitly lists which log groups to collect:

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  awscloudwatch:
    region: us-west-1
    profile: my-cloudwatch-profile  # Optional: use if you have a named AWS profile
    logs:
      poll_interval: 5m
      groups:
        named:
          /aws/eks/my-cluster/cluster:
          /aws/rds/instance/my-database/postgresql:
```

Configuration breakdown:
- `profile`: (Optional) The AWS credentials profile to use from `~/.aws/credentials`
- `named`: List specific log group names to collect (each name ends with a colon)

<Admonition type="info">

</Admonition>

## Step 5: Configure the logs pipeline

Enable the `awscloudwatch` receiver in your OTel Collector pipeline. Add or update the `logs` pipeline in the `service.pipelines` section of your `config.yaml`:

```yaml {4}:config.yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, awscloudwatch]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

The highlighted line shows the `awscloudwatch` receiver added to the logs pipeline. If you have existing receivers like `otlp`, keep them in the array.

<Admonition type="warning">
Make sure your `exporters` section includes the correct SigNoz endpoint. For SigNoz Cloud, this should be configured as:

```yaml:config.yaml
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      signoz-ingestion-key: <your-ingestion-key>
```

Replace:
- `<region>`: Your [SigNoz Cloud region]
- `<your-ingestion-key>`: Your ingestion key from [SigNoz Settings](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
</Admonition>

<KeyPointCallout title="Using self-hosted SigNoz?" defaultCollapsed="true">
Most steps are identical. To adapt this guide, update the endpoint and remove the ingestion key header as shown in [Cloud → Self-Hosted](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/cloud-vs-self-hosted/#cloud-to-self-hosted).
</KeyPointCallout>

## Step 6: Restart the collector

After updating the configuration, restart the OTel Collector to apply changes:

```bash
# If running as a systemd service
sudo systemctl restart otelcol-contrib

# If running directly
# Stop the current process (Ctrl+C) and restart with:
./otelcol-contrib --config config.yaml
```

## Validate

After a few minutes (based on your `poll_interval`), verify that logs are appearing in SigNoz:

1. Open your SigNoz instance and navigate to **Logs** → **Logs Explorer**
2. Look for logs with attributes matching your CloudWatch log groups
3. You should see logs with fields like:
   - `aws.cloudwatch.log_group_name`
   - `aws.cloudwatch.log_stream_name`

## Troubleshooting
</ToggleHeading>

### Logs are not appearing in SigNoz

**Symptoms**: No CloudWatch logs visible in SigNoz after waiting several poll intervals.

**Possible causes and fixes**:

1. **AWS credentials not found or invalid**
   - Verify the credentials file exists at `~/.aws/credentials`
   - Check that the file is readable by the user running the OTel Collector
   - Test credentials with: `aws logs describe-log-groups --region <your-region>`

2. **Insufficient IAM permissions**
   - Ensure the IAM policy includes both `logs:DescribeLogGroups` and `logs:FilterLogEvents`
   - Verify the policy is attached to the correct user/role

3. **Wrong region configured**
   - Confirm the `region` in your receiver config matches where your log groups exist

4. **Log group prefix doesn't match**
   - If using autodiscover with a prefix, verify your log groups actually start with that prefix
   - Try listing log groups: `aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix /aws/lambda/ --region <your-region>`

5. **Collector can't reach SigNoz**
   - Check network connectivity to `ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443`
   - Verify your ingestion key is correct

### Error: "failed to filter log events"

**Symptoms**: Collector logs show errors like `failed to filter log events`.

**Fix**: This usually indicates a permissions issue. Verify your IAM policy includes `logs:FilterLogEvents` and the resource ARN is correct.

### Collector uses too much memory

**Symptoms**: OTel Collector memory usage grows over time when collecting many log groups.

**Fix**: 
- Reduce the number of log groups by using a more specific prefix
- Increase the `poll_interval` to reduce polling frequency
- Use named log groups instead of autodiscovery to limit scope
