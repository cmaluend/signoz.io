## Overview

SigNoz can store and visualize Prometheus metrics. If you are already exposing metrics in Prometheus format (e.g., from a `/metrics` endpoint), you don't need to change your code. You can simply configure the OpenTelemetry Collector to "scrape" (collect) these metrics and send them to SigNoz.

## Prerequisites

- **SigNoz Otel Collector installed**: You need the OpenTelemetry Collector running in your environment. See [Installation Guides](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/get-started/).
- **Access to Configuration**: You must be able to edit the `otel-collector-config.yaml` file where the collector is running.
- **A Target**: An application or service exposing metrics on an HTTP endpoint (usually `/metrics`).

## Steps

To start collecting Prometheus metrics, you need to configure the **Prometheus Receiver** in your collector.

### Step 1: Configure the Scrape Job

Open your `otel-collector-config.yaml` file. In the `receivers` > `prometheus` > `config` > `scrape_configs` section, you define "jobs". A job tells the collector *what* to scrape and *how often*.

Add a new job for your service:

```yaml {6-13}
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        # Scrape the collector's own metrics
        - job_name: "otel-collector"
          scrape_interval: 30s
          static_configs:
            - targets: ["localhost:8889"]

        # Scrape your application metrics
        - job_name: "my-app-metrics"
          scrape_interval: 30s
          static_configs:
            - targets: ["localhost:8080"]
```


### Step 2: Enable the Receiver in the Pipeline

Ensure the `prometheus` receiver is added to your metrics pipeline. This is usually enabled by default, but it's good to verify.

Scroll down to `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` and check the `receivers` list:

```yaml {4}
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      # Ensure 'prometheus' is in this list
      receivers: [otlp, prometheus]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

### Step 3: Restart the Collector

For the changes to take effect, restart the OpenTelemetry Collector.


## Validate

1. Go to the **[Metrics Explorer](https://signoz.io/docs/metrics-management/metrics-explorer/)** in SigNoz.
2. Search for a metric from your application (e.g., `http_requests_total` or `go_goroutines`).
3. Run the query to confirm data is flowing.

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see metrics:
- **Check Logs**: Look at the OpenTelemetry Collector logs for connection errors (e.g., "connection refused").
- **Verify Endpoint**: Ensure you can `curl` the metrics endpoint from the machine running the collector.
- **Check Job Name**: Ensure the `job_name` is unique in your config.

## Next Steps

- **Create Dashboards**: Visualize your Prometheus metrics by creating custom dashboards. [Learn more](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/dashboards/).
- **Set Alerts**: Configure alerts to get notified when metrics cross a threshold. [Learn more](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/metrics-based-alerts/).
