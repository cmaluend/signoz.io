## Overview

OpenTelemetry receivers allow you to collect metrics from your infrastructure and third-party services (like Redis, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Nginx, etc.) without installing separate agents for each service.

Think of a **Receiver** as a plugin for the OpenTelemetry Collector. It connects to a specific service, gathers its metrics, and exports them to SigNoz or any other backend of your choice.

## Prerequisites

- **OpenTelemetry Collector**: You need the OpenTelemetry Collector running in your environment. See [Installation Guides](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/get-started/).
- **Access to Configuration**: You must be able to edit the `otel-collector-config.yaml` file where the collector is running.

## Steps

To start collecting metrics from a new source, you need to do two things:
1. **Define** the receiver (tell the collector *how* to connect to your service).
2. **Enable** the receiver (tell the collector to *process* data from this source).

### Step 1: Configure the Receiver

Open your `otel-collector-config.yaml` file. In the `receivers` section, add the configuration for the service you want to monitor.

You can choose **any receiver** available in the <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/?component=receiver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">OpenTelemetry Registry</a>; this example uses RabbitMQ, but the pattern is the same for other services.

For example, to monitor **RabbitMQ**, you would add:

```yaml
receivers:
  # ... existing receivers ...
  rabbitmq:
    endpoint: http://localhost:15672
    username: <RABBITMQ_USERNAME>
    password: <RABBITMQ_PASSWORD>
    collection_interval: 30s
```

`<RABBITMQ_USERNAME>` and `<RABBITMQ_PASSWORD>` are the credentials for the RabbitMQ management API; use a read-only account with access to metrics endpoints.

> **Note**: You can find the configuration settings for any service in the <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib repository</a>.

### Step 2: Enable the Receiver in the Pipeline

Just defining the receiver isn't enough; you must add it to the **pipeline** so the data is actually processed and sent to SigNoz.

Scroll down to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` section in your config file. Add your new receiver name (e.g., `rabbitmq`) to the `receivers` list.

```yaml {4}
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      # Add 'rabbitmq' to the list of receivers
      receivers: [otlp, rabbitmq]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

### Step 3: Restart the Collector

For the changes to take effect, you must restart the OpenTelemetry Collector.

## Validate

Once restarted, the metrics should start flowing into SigNoz.

1. Go to the **[Metrics Explorer](https://signoz.io/docs/metrics-management/metrics-explorer/)** in SigNoz.
2. In the query builder, search for metrics related to your service (e.g., type `rabbitmq` to see available RabbitMQ metrics).
3. Select a metric and run the query to verify data is present.

## Next Steps

- **Create Dashboards**: Visualize your metrics by creating custom dashboards. [Learn more](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/dashboards/).
- **Set Alerts**: Configure alerts to get notified when metrics cross a threshold. [Learn more](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/metrics-based-alerts/).

## Troubleshooting

- **Receiver not starting**: Check the collector logs for authentication errors to the target service; confirm the endpoint/credentials.
- **Metrics missing in SigNoz**: Ensure the receiver is added to `service.pipelines.metrics.receivers` and the pipeline uses an exporter pointed at SigNoz.
- **High cardinality warnings**: Review receiver-specific settings to limit label sets (e.g., drop unnecessary dimensions) or add a `filter`/`attributes` processor.
