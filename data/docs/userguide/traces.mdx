This page shows how you can use distributed tracing to retrieve detailed telemetry data and see how your applications are performing. This section explains:

- How to visualize aggregate metrics from traces
- How to filter your spans
- How to inspect a span

## Prerequisites

<PrereqsInstrument />

## Open the Traces Section

From the sidebar, select **Traces**:

## Visualize Aggregate Metrics from Traces

SigNoz allows you to create aggregates of your filtered traces with various aggregate functions. Refer to query builder aggregation docs [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/#aggregation)

## Filter Spans by Tags/Attributes

The Traces Explorer in SigNoz provides a feature for quick filtering of spans using various parameters. This functionality allows users to quickly search their specific spans, making it easier to analyze and debug applications.

There are two ways in which you can filter traces by tags:

- You can select a filter from the **Quick Filter**. More details on available quick filters are [here](/docs/product-features/trace-explorer/#quick-filters)

</figure>
- You can use the query builder. To access the query builder, select the **Search Filter** input. Then, use the dropdown list to select a key from the list of your attributes, select an operator and enter a value. When you’ve finished, select the **Stage and Run Query** button. Refer to [this doc](/docs/userguide/query-builder/#using-the-filtering-feature) for more details on Query Builder.


## Inspect a Span

To further troubleshoot your application, you can select a span from the list to view its details. For details, see the [Span Details](/docs/userguide/span-details) page.

## Missing Spans

A "missing span" in a trace means that the parent span ID of a span is missing. Every span has a **Span ID** and a **Parent Span ID**, except the root span which does not have a parent span ID. When a service makes a call to another service, the calling service's span ID becomes the parent span ID for the downstream service's span.

<summary>How Parent ID Propagation Works</summary>

Every span has two key identifiers: a **Span ID** and a **Parent Span ID**. When a service makes a call to a downstream service, it propagates context via the `traceparent` header. This header carries the current span's Span ID, which the downstream service uses as the Parent Span ID of the new span it creates.

The **root span** is the first span in a trace — it does not have a Parent Span ID because no upstream service initiated it.

For example, consider three services — `Frontend`, `Auth`, and `Database`:

1. `Frontend` creates the root span (Span ID: `abc1`, Parent ID: none).
2. `Frontend` calls `Auth`, passing its Span ID `abc1` in the `traceparent` header. `Auth` creates a new span (Span ID: `def2`, Parent ID: `abc1`).
3. `Auth` calls `Database`, passing its Span ID `def2`. `Database` creates a new span (Span ID: `ghi3`, Parent ID: `def2`).

If `Auth` fails to export its span (Span ID: `def2`), the `Database` span will reference a Parent Span ID (`def2`) that does not exist in the collected trace — resulting in a missing span.

</details>

### Common Causes
If you are seeing missing spans in your traces, it could be due to the following reasons:

- **Tail Sampling**: If you have configured tail sampling in your OpenTelemetry Collector pipeline, the sampler randomly selects a subset of spans to keep and drops the rest. This means some spans from a trace may be retained while others are discarded, resulting in incomplete traces with missing spans.

- **Network Issues**: Spans may be dropped in transit due to network issues between your application and the OpenTelemetry Collector, or between the Collector and SigNoz. This can happen due to transient connectivity failures, timeouts, or packet loss.

- **Uninstrumented or Misconfigured Services**: If a service in your request chain is not instrumented or is not exporting its spans to SigNoz, the spans it generates will be missing from the trace. Since its span ID is used as the parent span ID by downstream services, those downstream spans will appear as missing spans.

## Span Gaps

Sometimes it's possible that there are gaps between consequent spans. This happens when some process/code are not traced. For Example, by default OpenTelemetry auto instrumentation libraries do not trace the custom functions/methods. This can be fixed by adding manual instrumentation to the code.
