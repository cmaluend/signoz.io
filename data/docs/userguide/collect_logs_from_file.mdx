</KeyPointCallout>

## Overview

This documentation provides instructions on configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector with the <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/filelogreceiver/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">filelog</a> receiver to read application logs from a file and export them to SigNoz.

The `filelog` receiver tails and parses logs from files, making it ideal for legacy applications or systems that write logs to disk rather than stdout/stderr.

## Prerequisites

- An instance of [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/get-started/) running on your host
- An instance of SigNoz (either [Cloud](https://signoz.io/teams/) or [Self-Hosted](https://signoz.io/docs/install/self-host/))

## Sample Log File

For this guide, you can create a sample log file named `app.log` at `/tmp/app.log` (or any accessible path) with the following content:

```plaintext
2026-01-12T10:00:00.000Z INFO [main] Application started successfully
2026-01-12T10:00:01.500Z INFO [auth] User 'alice' logged in from 192.168.1.10
2026-01-12T10:00:02.100Z WARN [db] Query execution took longer than 500ms
2026-01-12T10:00:03.200Z ERROR [payment] Payment gateway timeout for transaction #12345
```

<Admonition type="info">
The filelog receiver sends each line as a separate log entry. To parse structured fields like timestamp, level, and message, you can use [SigNoz Logs Pipelines](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/introduction/) to parse logs after ingestion.
</Admonition>

## Configure Filelog Receiver

The following steps guide you through configuring the `filelog` receiver on different platforms.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="vm" label="VM" default>

<KeyPointCallout title="What classifies as VM?" defaultCollapsed={true}>
A VM is a virtual computer that runs on physical hardware. This includes:
- **Cloud VMs**: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs, DigitalOcean Droplets
- **On-premise VMs**: VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V, KVM
- **Bare metal servers**: Physical servers running Linux/Unix directly

Use this section if you're deploying your application directly on a server or VM without containerization.

</KeyPointCallout>

### 1. Install OpenTelemetry Collector

Follow this [guide](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) to install the OpenTelemetry Collector as an agent on your Virtual Machine.

### 2. Edit Configuration File

Locate your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file (typically `config.yaml` or `/etc/otel-collector/config.yaml`).

Add the `filelog` receiver to the `receivers` section:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml {2-4}
receivers:
  filelog/app:
    include: [/tmp/app.log] # Replace with your actual log file path
    start_at: end
```

<Admonition type="info">
**start_at**: The `start_at: end` configuration ensures that only newly added logs are transmitted. To include historical logs from the file, change this to `start_at: beginning`.
</Admonition>

The `/app` suffix in `filelog/app` is a custom identifier that allows you to configure multiple filelog receivers with different settings. You can name differently for different apps (e.g., `filelog/nginx`, `filelog/application`).

### 3. Enable in Pipeline

Add the `filelog` receiver to your logs pipeline in the `service` section of your configuration.

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml {4}
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, filelog/app] # Add filelog/app here
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

### 4. Restart Collector

Restart the OpenTelemetry Collector service for changes to take effect.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart otel-collector
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes">

The [SigNoz Kubernetes Infra Chart](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/k8s/k8s-infra/install-k8s-infra/) automatically collects logs from all pods by default. This is managed via the [presets.logsCollection.enabled](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/k8s/k8s-infra/configure-k8s-infra/#3-container-log-collection) property, which configures a `filelog` receiver to ingest logs from the standard Kubernetes log path (`/var/log/pods/*`).

**Recommendation:** For the best experience, configure your applications to log to `stdout` and `stderr`. This ensures they are automatically captured by the standard Kubernetes logging infrastructure without additional configuration.

<Admonition type="info">
The default configuration collects logs from all pods in the cluster. To filter specific namespaces or pods, you'll need to customize the filelog receiver configuration.
</Admonition>

<KeyPointCallout title="Collecting from custom file paths" defaultCollapsed={true}>

If your application writes logs to a specific file instead of `stdout` or `stderr`, you have two options:

1.  **Sidecar Pattern**: Deploy an OTel Collector as a sidecar container within the pod and use a shared volume to access the log files. See the <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/collector/components/#deployment-pattern" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">OTel Collector documentation</a> for sidecar deployment patterns.
2.  **hostPath Mount**: Mount the log directory from the node into the SigNoz Collector DaemonSet and configure the `filelog` receiver to read from that path.

</KeyPointCallout>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

If you are running the OpenTelemetry Collector as a Docker container, you need to mount the log file from your host machine into the container.

### 1. Edit Configuration File

Add the `filelog` receiver to the `receivers` section of your `otel-collector-config.yaml`:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml {2-4}
receivers:
  filelog:
    include: [/tmp/app.log] # Path inside the container
    start_at: end
```

### 2. Enable in Pipeline

Add the `filelog` receiver to your logs pipeline in the `service` section:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml {4}
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, filelog] # Add filelog here
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

### 3. Run Collector with Mounts

Run the collector container, mounting your host log file (e.g., `~/logs/app.log`) to the expected path inside the container (e.g., `/tmp/app.log`).

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name signoz-otel-collector \
  -v ~/logs/app.log:/tmp/app.log:ro \
  -v $(pwd)/otel-collector-config.yaml:/etc/otel/config.yaml \
  otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest \
  --config /etc/otel/config.yaml
```

<Admonition type="info">
For production deployments, pin to a specific version tag instead of `latest` to ensure consistency. Check the <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">releases page</a> for available versions.
</Admonition>

For more examples, see the [Collect Docker Logs](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/collect_docker_logs/) doc.

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

### 1. Install OpenTelemetry Collector

Follow this [guide](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) to install the OpenTelemetry Collector on Windows.

### 2. Edit Configuration File

Locate your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file (e.g., `C:\ProgramData\OpenTelemetry Collector\config.yaml`).

Add the `filelog` receiver to the `receivers` section, ensuring you use valid Windows paths (escape backslashes):

```yaml:config.yaml {2-4}
receivers:
  filelog/app:
    include: ["C:/Logs/app.log"]
    start_at: end
```

### 3. Enable in Pipeline

Add the `filelog` receiver to your logs pipeline:

```yaml:config.yaml {4}
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, filelog/app]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

### 4. Restart Service

Restart the OpenTelemetry Collector service via PowerShell:

```powershell
Restart-Service opentelemetry-collector
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Validate Logs

Once configured and restarted, generate some new logs in your file:

```bash
echo "Testing SigNoz filelog receiver $(date)" >> /tmp/app.log
echo "2026-01-12T12:00:00.000Z INFO [test] Manual log entry for verification" >> /tmp/app.log
echo "2026-01-12T12:00:01.500Z INFO [test] Manual log entry for verification" >> /tmp/app.log
echo "2026-01-12T12:00:02.100Z INFO [test] Manual log entry for verification" >> /tmp/app.log
echo "2026-01-12T12:00:03.200Z INFO [test] Manual log entry for verification" >> /tmp/app.log
```

For Windows, use PowerShell:

```powershell
Add-Content -Path "C:\Logs\app.log" -Value "Testing SigNoz filelog receiver $(Get-Date)"
Add-Content -Path "C:\Logs\app.log" -Value "2026-01-12T12:00:00.000Z INFO [test] Manual log entry for verification"
```

Go to the **SigNoz UI** -> **Logs** tab. You should see your new log entries appearing.

## Troubleshooting

</ToggleHeading>

### Logs not appearing in SigNoz

1.  **Check File Permissions**: Ensure the OpenTelemetry Collector user has **read** permissions for the log file. On Linux, the collector usually runs as `otel` or `root`.
    ```bash
    ls -l /tmp/app.log
    # Adjust permissions if necessary
    chmod 644 /tmp/app.log
    ```
2.  **Verify Path**: Double-check the path in the `include` config. For glob patterns (e.g. `*.log`), ensure it matches the actual files.
3.  **Check `start_at` Setting**: If you set `start_at: end` (default), the collector only reads _new_ lines written _after_ the collector starts. To see existing lines, change to `start_at: beginning` and restart the collector.
4.  **Check Collector Logs**: Look at the OTel Collector's own logs for errors (e.g. "permission denied", "no files found").
    ```bash
    # For systemd
    journalctl -u otel-collector -f
    # For Docker
    docker logs signoz-otel-collector
    ```

</details>

## Advanced Configuration

<KeyPointCallout title="Storage extension for production deployments" defaultCollapsed={true}>

For production use, especially when using `start_at: beginning`, configure a <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/extension/storage/filestorage/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">storage extension</a> to prevent log duplication on collector restarts. The storage extension saves the read position for each file to disk.

```yaml
extensions:
  file_storage:
    directory: /var/lib/otelcol/file_storage

receivers:
  filelog:
    include: [/tmp/app.log]
    start_at: beginning
    storage: file_storage # Reference the storage extension

service:
  extensions: [file_storage]
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [filelog]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Without a storage extension, using `start_at: beginning` will cause the collector to re-read all files from the beginning after each restart, potentially creating duplicate logs in SigNoz.
