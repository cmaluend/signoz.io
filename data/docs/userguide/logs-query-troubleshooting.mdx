This section helps you resolve common issues when querying logs in SigNoz.

## Querying Fields with Dots in Key Names

### Problem

When working with structured logs that contain keys with dots (like `result.description`), you may encounter issues when trying to query these fields directly. This is a common scenario with Azure logs such as AppServiceConsoleLogs.

Keys containing dots cannot be queried directly using standard syntax because the system interprets the dot as a path separator rather than part of the key name. For example, these queries will not work:

* `body.result.description EXISTS` (returns no results)
* `body['result.description'] EXISTS` (syntax error)
* `body["result.description"] EXISTS` (syntax error)
* `body CONTAINS 'result.description'` (returns no results)

### Solution: Use Log Pipelines

To work with fields that have dots in their key names, you can use log pipelines to transform the data:

1. Create a pipeline that extracts the value from the dotted key
2. Assign this value to a new key without dots
3. Query the new key normally

For example, if you have a field `result.description`, you can create a pipeline that copies its value to a new field like `result_description`, which can then be queried using standard syntax like `body.result_description EXISTS`.

See [Logs Pipeline Introduction](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/introduction/) for more details on creating pipelines.

**Note:** Support for querying keys with dots directly is currently in development and will be available soon (this will only be valid for keys inside log body).
