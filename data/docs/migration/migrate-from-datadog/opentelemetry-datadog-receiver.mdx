---

## Overview

The OpenTelemetry Datadog Receiver allows you to receive metrics from Datadog Agents without modifying your applications. This is useful for:

- **Gradual migration**: Continue using Datadog Agent while migrating to OpenTelemetry
- **DogStatsD metrics**: Receive custom DogStatsD metrics without changing application code

<Admonition type="info">
This approach is a bridge solution. For long-term use, we recommend migrating to native OpenTelemetry instrumentation for better integration and standardization.

<KeyPointCallout title="Using self-hosted SigNoz?" defaultCollapsed={true}>
Most steps are identical. To adapt this guide, update the endpoint and remove the ingestion key header as shown in [Cloud → Self-Hosted](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/cloud-vs-self-hosted/#cloud-to-self-hosted).
</KeyPointCallout>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/get-started/) installed and running
- **Datadog Agent** installed (if forwarding from existing agents)
- Access to modify configuration files and environment variables
- Network connectivity between Datadog Agent and OpenTelemetry Collector

## Step 1: Configure the Datadog Receiver

Add the Datadog receiver to your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration to accept Datadog Agent traffic.

**Add to your `otel-collector-config.yaml`:**

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
receivers:
  datadog:
    endpoint: 0.0.0.0:8125
    read_timeout: 60s
```

This configures the receiver to:
- Listen on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) on port `8125` (default Datadog DogStatsD port)
- Wait up to 60 seconds for data before timing out

## Step 2: Configure the Exporter

You can skip this step if you followed the steps in [OpenTelemetry Collector Installation](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/get-started/#installation) to configure the OpenTelemetry Collector.

Set up the OTLP exporter to send data to SigNoz:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443
    headers:
      signoz-ingestion-key: <SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>
    tls:
      insecure: false
```

Replace:
- `<region>`: Your SigNoz Cloud region (`us`, `eu`, or `in`)
- `<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>`: Your ingestion key from [Settings → Ingestion Settings](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

## Step 3: Update the Pipelines

Integrate the Datadog receiver into your pipelines:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [datadog, otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

## Step 4: Configure the Datadog Agent

Configure your Datadog Agent to forward data to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

### Option A: Forward to Both SigNoz and Datadog

If you want to send data to both SigNoz (via OTel Collector) and Datadog during migration:

**Using environment variable:**

```bash
DD_ADDITIONAL_ENDPOINTS='{"http://<OTEL_COLLECTOR_HOST>:8125": ["signoz"]}'
```

**Or update `datadog.yaml`:**

```yaml:datadog.yaml
additional_endpoints:
  "http://<OTEL_COLLECTOR_HOST>:8125":
    - "signoz"
```

Replace `<OTEL_COLLECTOR_HOST>` with the hostname or IP where your OTel Collector is running (e.g., `localhost`, `otel-collector.default.svc.cluster.local`).

### Option B: Forward Only to SigNoz

To send data exclusively to SigNoz (stop sending to Datadog):

**Using environment variable:**

```bash
DD_DD_URL=http://<OTEL_COLLECTOR_HOST>:8125
```

**Or update `datadog.yaml`:**

```yaml:datadog.yaml
dd_url: http://<OTEL_COLLECTOR_HOST>:8125
```

## Step 5: Restart Services

After making configuration changes:

1. Restart the OpenTelemetry Collector

2. Restart the Datadog Agent
   
## Validate

Verify data is flowing through the Datadog receiver to SigNoz:

1. **Verify in SigNoz:**
   - Navigate to **Metrics** to see DogStatsD metrics
   - Check that metrics match your Datadog data

2. **Compare with Datadog:**
   - Verify the same metrics appear in both platforms

## Troubleshooting
</ToggleHeading>

### Connection refused errors

If the Datadog Agent can't connect to the OTel Collector:

1. **Check port binding**: Verify the Collector is listening on port 8125:
   ```bash
   netstat -tlnp | grep 8125
   ```

2. **Check firewall**: Ensure port 8125 is open between Agent and Collector.

3. **Verify endpoint**: Confirm the Agent is configured with the correct Collector address.

### No data appearing in SigNoz

1. **Check Collector logs**: Look for errors in the OTel Collector logs.

2. **Verify pipeline configuration**: Ensure the `datadog` receiver is listed in the appropriate pipeline(s).

### Metrics not appearing

1. **Check metric type**: The Datadog receiver may not support all metric types.

2. **Verify DogStatsD configuration**: Ensure DogStatsD is properly configured in both Agent and Collector.

3. **Check metric names**: Metrics may be renamed during translation to OTel format.

## Limitations

Be aware of these limitations when using the Datadog receiver:

- **Not all features supported**: Some Datadog-specific features may not translate to OpenTelemetry
- **Metric types**: Some Datadog metric types may be converted differently
- **Performance**: Adding a hop (DD Agent → OTel Collector → SigNoz) adds latency

## Next Steps

The Datadog receiver is a bridge solution. For long-term benefits, consider migrating to native OpenTelemetry:

- [Migrate Traces to OpenTelemetry](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-datadog/traces/)
- [Migrate Metrics to OpenTelemetry](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-datadog/metrics/)
- [Migrate Logs to OpenTelemetry](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-datadog/logs/)
