description: Learn how to migrate your alerts from Datadog to SigNoz.
doc_type: howto
---

While migrating your observability stack from Datadog to SigNoz, you'll need to recreate your alerts in SigNoz's alert management system.

## Prerequisites

- A SigNoz account (SigNoz Cloud or Self-Hosted).
- List of existing monitors and notification channels from Datadog.
- Data flowing to SigNoz (metrics, traces, or logs depending on your alerts).

## Migration Steps

### Setting Up Notification Channels

Before migrating your alerts, set up the notification channels you want to use.

#### Supported Notification Channels
</ToggleHeading>

Below is a list of notification channels supported by Datadog and SigNoz:

| Notification Channel | Datadog               | SigNoz               |
|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Email                | ✓                     | ✓                    |
| Slack                | ✓                     | ✓                    |
| Microsoft Teams      | ✓                     | ✓                    |
| PagerDuty            | ✓                     | ✓                    |
| OpsGenie             | ✓                     | ✓                    |
| Webhook              | ✓                     | ✓                    |
| Incident.io          | Via Webhook           | ✓ (via Webhook)      |
| Rootly               | Via Webhook           | ✓ (via Webhook)      |
| Zenduty              | Via Webhook           | ✓ (via Webhook)      |
| ServiceNow           | ✓                     | Via Webhook          |
| Jira                 | ✓                     | Via Webhook          |
| AWS SNS              | ✓                     | Via Webhook          |
| VictorOps/Splunk     | ✓                     | Via Webhook          |

If the notification channel you need is not listed, you can use the **Webhook** channel to integrate with other tools.

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Alerts Notification Channel documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/notification-channel).

### Setting Up Alert Rules

SigNoz provides a comprehensive alert management system. Migrate your existing Datadog monitors by mapping them to the corresponding alert types in SigNoz:

#### Alert Rule Mapping

| Datadog Monitor Type | SigNoz Alert Type | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Metric Monitor** | [Metric Alert](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/metrics-based-alerts/) | Convert Datadog query to PromQL |
| **Log Monitor** | [Log Alert](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/log-based-alerts/) | Use Query Builder to recreate log filters |
| **APM Monitor** (Trace Analytics) | [Trace Alert](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/trace-based-alerts/) | Alert on latency, error rates, or span attributes |
| **Anomaly Monitor** | [Anomaly Alert](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/anomaly-based-alerts/) | Detects deviations without static thresholds |
| **Composite Monitor** | Multiple Alerts | Create separate alerts, consider using labels for grouping |
| **Forecast Monitor** | - | Not currently supported |
| **Outlier Monitor** | - | Not currently supported |
| **Watchdog Monitor** | - | Use Anomaly Alert as alternative |

### Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

If you define alert rules as code in Datadog (using the Datadog Terraform provider), you can continue using the same approach with SigNoz.

Use the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SigNoz/signoz/latest/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SigNoz Terraform Provider</a> to manage your alerts and notification channels programmatically.

## Validate

To confirm that your alerts are migrated correctly:

1. Test alerts by temporarily lowering thresholds or triggering test conditions.
2. Verify that notifications are sent to the configured channels.
3. Monitor for any missed alerts during the transition period.

## Troubleshooting
</ToggleHeading>

### Alerts not triggering

- **Check Data**: Ensure that the data (metrics, logs, traces) required for the alert is being received by SigNoz.
- **Verify Query**: Use the Query Builder to verify that your alert query returns the expected values.
- **Check Thresholds**: Ensure that the threshold conditions are met by your current data.
- **Evaluation Interval**: Check the evaluation interval and ensure the condition persists long enough to trigger the alert.
- **Metric Names**: Verify you're using OpenTelemetry metric names, not Datadog names.

### Notifications not received

- **Test Channel**: Use the "Test" button in the alert channel configuration to verify connectivity.
- **Check Spam Folder**: If using email, check your spam folder.
- **Verify Webhook URL**: If using webhooks, ensure the URL is correct and accessible from the SigNoz instance.
- **Check Network**: For self-hosted, ensure SigNoz can reach external notification services.

### Query errors in alerts

- **Validate PromQL**: Test your PromQL query in the Metrics Explorer first.
- **Check attribute names**: Ensure you're using OpenTelemetry attribute naming conventions.
- **Verify metric availability**: Confirm the metric exists in your SigNoz instance.

### Alert too noisy/quiet

- **Adjust thresholds**: Fine-tune thresholds based on your SigNoz data patterns.
- **Modify evaluation window**: Increase evaluation window to reduce noise.
- **Add filters**: Add more specific filters to reduce alert scope.
