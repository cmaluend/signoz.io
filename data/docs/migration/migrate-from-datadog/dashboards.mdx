title: Migrate Dashboards from Datadog
description: Learn how to migrate your Datadog dashboards to SigNoz using templates or custom creation.
doc_type: howto
---

Datadog dashboards need to be recreated in SigNoz due to differences in query languages and dashboard schemas. However, SigNoz provides tools and templates to make this process smoother.

## Prerequisites

- A SigNoz account (SigNoz Cloud or Self-Hosted).
- Access to your existing Datadog dashboards (for reference).
- Data flowing to SigNoz (metrics, traces, or logs depending on your dashboards).

## Migration Strategies

### Using Dashboard Templates

SigNoz provides several pre-built dashboard templates that match common Datadog dashboards:

1. **Find Template**  
   Browse the <a href="https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SigNoz Dashboard Templates repository</a> to find a matching dashboard.

   <Admonition type="info">
   SigNoz provides a built-in [Infrastructure Monitoring module](https://signoz.io/docs/infrastructure-monitoring/overview/) that covers both host and Kubernetes monitoring. Pre-built dashboards are optional and can be used for additional customization.

2. **Import Dashboard**  
   - Navigate to **Dashboards** in SigNoz.
   - Click **+ New Dashboard**.
   - Click **Import JSON**.
   - Either paste the JSON content or upload the file from the repository.

### Using the Automated Migration Tool

For faster dashboard migration, try the [SigNoz Datadog Migration Tool](https://signoz.io/datadog-migration-tool/). This tool helps translate Datadog dashboard JSON to SigNoz format.

### Creating Custom Dashboards

If there is no existing template, create a custom dashboard in SigNoz.

- Follow the [Manage Dashboards guide](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/#steps-to-create-a-custom-dashboard/) for step-by-step instructions.
- Use the **Query Builder** to translate your Datadog queries

### Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

You can manage your dashboards as code using the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SigNoz/signoz/latest/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SigNoz Terraform Provider</a>. This allows you to version control your dashboards and automate their deployment.

## Feature Comparison

### Dashboard Features

SigNoz supports essential dashboard features including:

- **[Variables](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-variables/)**: Create template variables for dynamic dashboards.
- **[Panel Types](https://signoz.io/docs/dashboards/panel-types/)**: Various visualization options.
- **[Query Builder](https://signoz.io/docs/product-features/query-builder/)**: Construct queries visually or using PromQL/ClickHouse SQL.

### Panel Types

SigNoz supports most common panel types found in Datadog:

| Time Series     | ✓       | ✓      | Both support time series visualization |
| Bar Chart       | ✓       | ✓      | Both support categorical data |

| Table           | ✓       | ✓      | Both support tabular data |
| Histogram       | ✓       | ✓      | Distribution visualization |
| Value/Query Value | ✓     | ✓      | Single value display with thresholds |
| Top List        | ✓       | ✓      | Use Table panel with sorting |
| Heatmap         | ✓       | -      | Coming soon |
| Log Stream      | ✓       | ✓      | [List panel type](https://signoz.io/docs/dashboards/panel-types/list/) |
| Trace Flame Graph | ✓     | ✓      | Built-in Traces Explorer |
| SLO Widget      | ✓       | -      | Not directly supported in SigNoz |

Please refer to the [Panel Types documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/dashboards/panel-types/) for more details.

### Variables

Both Datadog and SigNoz support dashboard variables:

| Feature | Datadog | SigNoz |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Custom variable | ✓ | ✓ |
| Query-based variable | ✓ | ✓ |
| Multi-value selection | ✓ | ✓ |
| All option | ✓ | ✓ |

See [Manage Variables](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-variables/) for setup instructions.

## Validate

To confirm that your dashboards are migrated correctly:

1. Navigate to **Dashboards** in SigNoz.
2. Open your newly created dashboard.
3. Verify that all panels are populating with data.
4. Check that variables are working as expected.
5. Compare visualizations with the original Datadog dashboard.

## Troubleshooting
</ToggleHeading>

### Empty Charts

If your charts are empty:

- Verify that the metrics used in the query are being received by SigNoz.
- Check the time range of the dashboard.
- Ensure that any variables used have valid values selected.
- Confirm metric names match OpenTelemetry conventions (not Datadog names).

### Query Errors

If you see query errors:

- Check the syntax of your query.
- Use the Query Builder to construct valid queries interactively.
- Verify that the metric names and labels used are correct.
- Check that attributes are using OpenTelemetry naming conventions.

### Metric Values Don't Match

If values differ from Datadog:

- **Check aggregation functions**: Datadog and SigNoz may use different defaults.
- **Verify time alignment**: Ensure both dashboards use the same time range.
- **Check collection intervals**: Different scrape intervals can cause variations.
- **Review metric types**: Counter vs gauge handling may differ.

### Variables Not Working

If dashboard variables don't populate:

- Check the variable query syntax.
- Verify the metric/attribute exists in your data.
- Test the query directly in the Query Builder.
