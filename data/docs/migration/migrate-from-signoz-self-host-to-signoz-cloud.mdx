## Overview

This guide walks you through migrating from a self-hosted SigNoz instance to SigNoz Cloud. The migration involves:

1. **Telemetry pipeline**: Redirecting your applications and collectors to send data to SigNoz Cloud
2. **Dashboards and configuration**: Migrating dashboards, alerts, pipelines, saved views, and user settings via SigNoz support

<Admonition type="warning">
Historical telemetry data (traces, logs, metrics) cannot be migrated. Only metadata and configurations are transferred. Plan your migration timeline accordingly if you need to retain access to historical data in your self-hosted instance.
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

Before starting the migration:

- **SigNoz Cloud account**: [Sign up for SigNoz Cloud](https://signoz.io/teams/) if you haven't already
- **Ingestion key**: Obtain your ingestion key from [SigNoz Cloud settings](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- **Region**: Note your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint) (`us`, `eu`, or `in`)
- **Self-hosted access**: Admin access to your self-hosted SigNoz instance and its SQLite database

## Migration Approach

The recommended approach is to run both systems in parallel during migration:

1. Configure your telemetry pipeline to send data to SigNoz Cloud
2. Validate data is flowing correctly
3. Migrate dashboards and configurations
4. Continue running self-hosted until you're confident in the cloud setup
5. Decommission self-hosted when ready

This approach ensures zero data loss during the transition.

## Step 1: Update Your Telemetry Pipeline

Choose the tab that matches your current setup:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="own-collector" label="Using Your Own OTel Collector" default>

If you're using your own OpenTelemetry Collector that forwards data to SigNoz self-hosted, update the exporter configuration.

### Update OTel Collector Configuration

In your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file, update the `exporters` section to point to SigNoz Cloud:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml {3-6}
exporters:
  otlp/signoz-cloud:
    endpoint: "https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
    headers:
      signoz-ingestion-key: "SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY"
    tls:
      insecure: false
```

Replace the following placeholders:
- `<region>`: Your SigNoz Cloud region (`us`, `eu`, or `in`). See [endpoint reference](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint).
- `<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>`: Your ingestion key from [SigNoz Cloud settings](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/).

Then update your `service.pipelines` to use the new exporter:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml {4,6,8}
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      exporters: [otlp/signoz-cloud]
    metrics:
      exporters: [otlp/signoz-cloud]
    logs:
      exporters: [otlp/signoz-cloud]
```

### Restart Your Collector

Restart the OpenTelemetry Collector to apply the configuration changes.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="direct-to-signoz" label="Sending Directly to Self-Hosted SigNoz">

If your applications send telemetry directly to SigNoz self-hosted's [built-in collector](https://signoz.io/docs/architecture/), you have two options:

### Option A: Send Directly to SigNoz Cloud

Update your application's OpenTelemetry SDK configuration to send directly to SigNoz Cloud. Set these environment variables:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
```

Replace `<region>` and `<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>` with your values from [SigNoz Cloud settings](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/).

For language-specific configuration, see the [instrumentation guides](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/).

### Option B: Deploy Your Own OTel Collector (Recommended)

Deploying a dedicated collector gives you more control over data processing, batching, and routing.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes">

Follow the [Kubernetes OTel Collector guide](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/kubernetes-infra-metrics/) to deploy a collector in your cluster. Configure the exporter to send to SigNoz Cloud:

```yaml:override-values.yaml
global:
  cloud: others
  clusterName: <CLUSTER_NAME>
  deploymentEnvironment: <DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT>
otelCollectorEndpoint: ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443
otelInsecure: false
signozApiKey: <SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>
presets:
  otlpExporter:
    enabled: true
  loggingExporter:
    enabled: false
```

Then update your applications to send data to the collector instead of directly to SigNoz:
- **gRPC**: `http://<collector-service>:4317`
- **HTTP**: `http://<collector-service>:4318`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vm" label="VM / Bare Metal">

Follow the [VM OTel Collector guide](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) to install the collector. Configure the exporter to send to SigNoz Cloud:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
    headers:
      signoz-ingestion-key: "SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY"
    tls:
      insecure: false
```

Then update your applications to send data to the local collector:
- **gRPC**: `http://localhost:4317`
- **HTTP**: `http://localhost:4318`

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Validate Data Flow

Before migrating dashboards, confirm that telemetry data is reaching SigNoz Cloud:

1. **Open SigNoz Cloud**
3. **Check each signal type**:
   - **Traces**: Go to Traces Explorer and filter by your service names
   - **Metrics**: Go to Metrics Explorer and search for your application metrics
   - **Logs**: Go to Logs Explorer and verify log ingestion

If data is not appearing, see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## Step 3: Migrate Dashboards and Configuration

SigNoz support handles the migration of metadata from your self-hosted instance, including:

- Dashboards
- Alerts
- Log pipelines
- Saved views
- User accounts and settings

### How to Request Migration

1. **Locate your SQLite database file**  

2. **Export and compress the file**  
   ```bash
   # For Docker
   cp ./signoz/deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/data/signoz/signoz.db ./signoz-backup.db
   gzip signoz-backup.db
   ```

3. **Submit to SigNoz support**  
   Send the compressed file to [SigNoz support](https://signoz.io/support/) with your SigNoz Cloud organization details. The team will import your dashboards, alerts, and configurations.

4. **Receive confirmation**  
   Once the migration is complete, you'll receive confirmation and can verify your configurations in SigNoz Cloud.

## Step 4: Verify Complete Migration

After receiving confirmation from support:

1. **Review dashboards**: Open each migrated dashboard and verify panels display data correctly
2. **Test alerts**: Check that alert rules are configured and evaluate against incoming data
3. **Verify pipelines**: If you use log pipelines, confirm they're processing logs as expected
4. **Check saved views**: Verify your saved views in Traces, Logs, and Metrics explorers

## Step 5: Decommission Self-Hosted (Optional)

Once you're confident the migration is complete:

1. **Set a cutover date**: Communicate to your team when self-hosted access will end
2. **Update documentation**: Update internal runbooks to reference SigNoz Cloud
3. **Shut down self-hosted**: Stop the SigNoz services and reclaim infrastructure resources

## Estimate Your SigNoz Cloud Costs

To estimate your SigNoz Cloud bill based on current self-hosted usage, collect usage data from your existing instance.

### Reset Usage Tables

Connect to your self-hosted ClickHouse instance and truncate the usage tables to start fresh measurement:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE signoz_traces.usage ON CLUSTER cluster;
TRUNCATE TABLE signoz_metrics.usage ON CLUSTER cluster;
TRUNCATE TABLE signoz_logs.usage ON CLUSTER cluster;
```

### Collect Usage Data

1. Restart your SigNoz OTel collectors to begin fresh tracking
2. Let the system run with normal traffic for **at least 24 hours**
3. Connect to ClickHouse following the [connection guide](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/clickhouse/connect-to-clickhouse/)
4. Export usage data to CSV files:

```sql
-- Export traces usage
SELECT * FROM signoz_traces.usage
INTO OUTFILE 'traces_usage.csv'
FORMAT CSVWithNames;

-- Export metrics usage  
SELECT * FROM signoz_metrics.usage
INTO OUTFILE 'metrics_usage.csv'
FORMAT CSVWithNames;

-- Export logs usage
SELECT * FROM signoz_logs.usage
INTO OUTFILE 'logs_usage.csv'
FORMAT CSVWithNames;
```

Contact [SigNoz support](https://signoz.io/support/) with these CSV files for a cost estimate

## Troubleshooting
</ToggleHeading>

### Data not appearing in SigNoz Cloud

**Symptoms**: Services or telemetry data not visible in SigNoz Cloud after updating configuration.

**Check the following**:

1. **Verify endpoint format** — Ensure you're using `https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443` with the correct region
2. **Check ingestion key** — Confirm the key is valid and hasn't been revoked in SigNoz Cloud settings
3. **Test network connectivity** — From your collector/application host:
   ```bash
   curl -v https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443/v1/traces
   ```
   You should receive an HTTP response (even if it's an error about missing data)
4. **Check collector logs** — Look for export errors in your OTel Collector logs
5. **Verify TLS** — SigNoz Cloud requires HTTPS. Ensure your exporter is configured for secure connections

### Dashboards showing "No Data" after migration

**Symptoms**: Migrated dashboards exist but panels show no data.

**Likely causes**:
- Service names or metric names differ between environments
- Time range is set to before migration started

**Resolution**:
1. Adjust the dashboard time range to after you started sending data to SigNoz Cloud
2. Edit panel queries to match the service/metric names in your new environment
