This documentation will guide you through migrating from Honeycomb to SigNoz, leveraging the fact that both platforms now use OpenTelemetry as their primary instrumentation standard. With <a href="https://docs.honeycomb.io/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/recommended-migrations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Honeycomb's transition to OpenTelemetry-first approach and deprecation of legacy SDKs by August 12, 2025</a>, the migration path has been significantly simplified.
This guide will walk you through the migration process for both SigNoz Cloud and Self-Hosted deployments.

## Why Migrate to SigNoz?

SigNoz offers several advantages over Honeycomb:

- **Unified Observability**: Logs, metrics, and traces in one platform

- **Cost-Effective**: Predictable pricing without per-event charges

- **Open Source**: Full control over your observability stack
- **OpenTelemetry Native**: Built from the ground up with OpenTelemetry
- **Self-Hosted Option**: Keep your data on your infrastructure

## Migration Strategy

The migration strategy depends on your current setup:

If you're already using OpenTelemetry with Honeycomb, migration is straightforward - [**simply change your OTLP endpoint**](/docs/migration/migrate-from-honeycomb/data) to point to SigNoz. No SDK changes or re-instrumentation required.

### For Legacy SDK Users (Two-Step Process)

If you're still using Honeycomb's legacy SDKs, follow this approach:
