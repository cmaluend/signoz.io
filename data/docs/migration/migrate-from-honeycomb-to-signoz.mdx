This documentation guides you through migrating from Honeycomb to SigNoz. Since both platforms use OpenTelemetry, the migration is simplified.

## Why Migrate to SigNoz?

- **Unified Observability**: Logs, metrics, and traces in one platform.
- **Cost-Effective**: Predictable pricing.
- **Open Source**: Full control over your stack.
- **OpenTelemetry Native**: Built on OpenTelemetry.

## Migration Strategy

### For OpenTelemetry Users

If you're already using OpenTelemetry with Honeycomb, [**change your OTLP endpoint**](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-honeycomb/data) to point to SigNoz.

### For Legacy SDK Users

1. **Migrate to OpenTelemetry**: Follow Honeycomb's guides to move off legacy SDKs:
