SigNoz provides a unified OpenTelemetry-native solution for monitoring metrics, traces/APM, and logs, allowing for greater flexibility and control over your data. This guide outlines the process of migrating your existing ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) setup to SigNoz.

## Why Migrate to SigNoz?

While the ELK Stack is a powerful platform, migrating to SigNoz offers several distinct advantages:

- **Unified Platform**: SigNoz provides a single, cohesive platform that eliminates the complexity of managing multiple components such as Elasticsearch clusters, Logstash pipelines, and Kibana.
- **Native OpenTelemetry Support**: Built from the ground up to support OpenTelemetry, ensuring seamless integration with modern instrumentation standards and future-proof observability.
- **Integrated Signals**: SigNoz correlates logs, metrics, and traces out-of-the-box, providing a more seamless debugging experience compared to correlating data across Kibana and separate APM UIs.
- **Resource Efficiency**: SigNoz (built on ClickHouse) often requires fewer resources and offers faster query performance compared to Elasticsearch for observability workloads.
- **Cost Efficiency**: SigNoz often provides significant cost savings with transparent pricing for both Cloud and Self-Hosted options.

## Prerequisites

Before starting your migration, ensure you have:

- A SigNoz account (Cloud) or a running SigNoz instance (Self-Hosted).
- Access to your ELK configuration (Filebeat, Logstash, Kibana) to view existing configurations.
- Permissions to modify your application's instrumentation and infrastructure configuration.

## Migration Guides

Follow these specific guides to migrate each aspect of your observability stack:

- **[Migrate Metrics](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-elk/metrics)**: Transition your Metricbeat modules and infrastructure metrics to OpenTelemetry and SigNoz.

- **[Migrate Traces/APM](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-elk/traces)**: Replace Elastic APM agents with OpenTelemetry instrumentation for distributed tracing/APM.

- **[Migrate Logs](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-elk/logs)**: Configure log collection using OpenTelemetry Collector or FluentBit to send logs to SigNoz.

- **[Migrate Dashboards](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-elk/dashboards)**: Recreate your Kibana dashboards in SigNoz using our powerful query builder and visualization options.

- **[Migrate Alerts](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-elk/alerts)**: Set up alerts in SigNoz to match your existing Kibana or ElastAlert rules.
