description: Learn how to migrate your JSON logs from Seq to SigNoz using OpenTelemetry Collector with filelog receiver.
doc_type: howto
---

## Overview

If you're looking to migrate your existing JSON logs from Seq to SigNoz without modifying your application code, you can use the OpenTelemetry Collector with a filelog receiver to parse and send your exported Seq logs to SigNoz.

This guide walks you through:

1. Exporting logs from Seq to JSON format
2. Configuring OpenTelemetry Collector with filelog receiver
3. Parsing Seq's JSON log format with proper operators
4. Mapping Seq fields to SigNoz attributes

<KeyPointCallout title="Using self-hosted SigNoz?" defaultCollapsed={true}>
Most steps are identical. To adapt this guide, update the endpoint and remove the ingestion key header as shown in [Cloud → Self-Hosted](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/cloud-vs-self-hosted/#cloud-to-self-hosted).
</KeyPointCallout>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A SigNoz account ([Cloud](https://signoz.io/teams/)) or a running SigNoz instance (Self-Hosted)
- Access to your Seq instance and ability to export logs
- OpenTelemetry Collector installed or ready to be installed

## Step 1: Export Logs from Seq

First, export your Seq logs to JSON files. Seq provides built-in functionality to export log data in JSON format.

Follow the [Seq documentation for exporting log data](https://datalust.co/docs/exporting-log-data) to create archive files in JSON format. This will create JSON files containing your log events with all their associated properties.

## Step 2: Set Up the OpenTelemetry Collector

Install the OpenTelemetry Collector if you haven't already:

1. [Install the OpenTelemetry Collector](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/get-started/) in your environment.
2. Ensure the OTLP exporter is configured to send data to SigNoz.

For detailed instructions on setting up the collector with filelog receiver, refer to the [SigNoz documentation for collecting logs from files](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/collect_logs_from_file/).

## Step 3: Configure Log Parsing Operators

To properly parse Seq's JSON log format, you'll need to add specific operators to your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration.

### Basic Filelog Receiver Configuration

First, configure the filelog receiver to read your exported Seq JSON files:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include:
      - /path/to/seq/exports/*.json
    start_at: beginning  # Use 'beginning' to process all existing logs, or 'end' for new logs only
    include_file_path: true
    include_file_name: true
    operators:
      - type: json_parser
        timestamp:
          parse_from: attributes["@t"]
          layout_type: gotime
          layout: "2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00"
```

Replace `/path/to/seq/exports/*.json` with the actual path to your exported Seq log files.

### Transform Processor Configuration

Add a transform processor to extract the log body, service name, and deployment environment from your Seq logs:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
processors:
  transform/seq:
    error_mode: ignore
    log_statements:
      # Extract log message body from Seq's @m or @mt fields
      - set(log.body, log.attributes["@m"]) where log.attributes["@m"] != nil
      - set(log.body, log.attributes["@mt"]) where log.attributes["@m"] == nil and log.attributes["@mt"] != nil
      # Map Seq's Application field to service.name
      - set(resource.attributes["service.name"], log.attributes["Application"]) where log.attributes["Application"] != nil
      # Map Seq's EnvironmentName to deployment.environment
      - set(resource.attributes["deployment.environment"], log.attributes["EnvironmentName"]) where log.attributes["EnvironmentName"] != nil

  batch:
    timeout: 1s
    send_batch_size: 1024
```

### Complete Pipeline Configuration

Enable the receivers and processors in your pipeline:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml {4,5,6}
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [filelog]
      processors: [transform/seq, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

## Step 4: Configure Data Processing Mode

The `start_at` parameter in your filelog receiver configuration determines how logs are processed:

- **`beginning`**: Process all existing log data from your exported files. Use this when migrating historical logs.
- **`end`**: Only tail new logs as they're added. Use this if you only want to collect new logs going forward.

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml {5}
receivers:
  filelog:
    include:
      - /path/to/seq/exports/*.json
    start_at: beginning  # Change to 'end' for tailing only
```

## Understanding Seq's JSON Structure

Seq exports logs with specific field names:

| Seq Field | Description | Mapped To |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| `@t` | Timestamp | Parsed as log timestamp |
| `@m` | Rendered message | Log body |
| `@mt` | Message template | Log body (fallback if `@m` is not present) |
| `@l` | Log level | Severity |
| `Application` | Application name | `service.name` resource attribute |
| `EnvironmentName` | Environment | `deployment.environment` resource attribute |

The configuration above automatically maps these fields to their SigNoz equivalents.

## Additional Field Mapping

You can map additional fields from your Seq logs to SigNoz attributes by adding more transform statements following the same pattern.

For example, to map additional custom fields:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
processors:
  transform/seq:
    error_mode: ignore
    log_statements:
      # ... existing mappings ...
      # Map custom fields
      - set(resource.attributes["host.name"], log.attributes["MachineName"]) where log.attributes["MachineName"] != nil
      - set(log.attributes["user.id"], log.attributes["UserId"]) where log.attributes["UserId"] != nil
```

Simply identify the field names in your Seq JSON structure and create corresponding mapping rules using the `set()` function.

## Complete Configuration Example

Here's a complete OpenTelemetry Collector configuration for migrating Seq logs:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include:
      - /var/log/seq-exports/*.json
    start_at: beginning
    include_file_path: true
    include_file_name: true
    operators:
      - type: json_parser
        timestamp:
          parse_from: attributes["@t"]
          layout_type: gotime
          layout: "2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00"

processors:
  transform/seq:
    error_mode: ignore
    log_statements:
      - set(log.body, log.attributes["@m"]) where log.attributes["@m"] != nil
      - set(log.body, log.attributes["@mt"]) where log.attributes["@m"] == nil and log.attributes["@mt"] != nil
      - set(resource.attributes["service.name"], log.attributes["Application"]) where log.attributes["Application"] != nil
      - set(resource.attributes["deployment.environment"], log.attributes["EnvironmentName"]) where log.attributes["EnvironmentName"] != nil

  batch:
    timeout: 1s
    send_batch_size: 1024

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
    headers:
      "signoz-access-token": "<your-ingestion-key>"

service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [filelog]
      processors: [transform/seq, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Replace:
- `/var/log/seq-exports/*.json` with your actual export path
- `<region>` with your SigNoz Cloud region
- `<your-ingestion-key>` with your actual ingestion key

## Validate

Verify logs are flowing correctly from Seq to SigNoz.

### Check Logs Are Arriving

1. In SigNoz, navigate to **Logs** in the left sidebar.
2. Use the **Logs Explorer** to browse recent logs.
3. Verify logs from your Seq exports appear with the correct timestamps.

### Verify Log Attributes

1. Click on a log entry to expand it.
2. Check that parsed fields are correct:
   - **Body**: Should contain the log message from `@m` or `@mt`
   - **Timestamp**: Should match the original Seq timestamp
   - **service.name**: Should reflect the `Application` field from Seq
   - **deployment.environment**: Should reflect the `EnvironmentName` field

### Verify Service Name

Filter logs by service name to ensure logs are properly grouped:

```
service.name = '<your-application-name>'
```

## Troubleshooting
</ToggleHeading>

### Logs not appearing in SigNoz

1. **Check Collector status**: Verify the OpenTelemetry Collector is running and check its logs for errors.
   ```bash
   # Check collector logs
   journalctl -u otel-collector -f
   ```
2. **Verify file permissions**: Ensure the Collector has read access to the Seq export files.
3. **Check file paths**: Confirm the `include` patterns in filelog receiver match your export file paths.
4. **Test connectivity**: Verify the Collector can reach SigNoz.

### Logs appear but are unparsed

If logs show as raw text without parsed fields:

1. **Verify JSON format**: Ensure exported files are valid JSON. Test with:
   ```bash
   jq . /path/to/seq/export.json
   ```
2. **Check operator configuration**: Verify the `json_parser` operator is correctly configured.
3. **Inspect field names**: Seq exports might use different field names in some versions. Check your actual export structure.

### Timestamp parsing errors

If timestamps are incorrect:

1. **Check timestamp format**: Ensure the `layout` matches your Seq timestamp format.
2. **Verify timezone**: The layout includes timezone offset (`Z07:00`). Adjust if needed.
3. **Check field name**: Confirm Seq uses `@t` for timestamps in your exports.

### Missing service names or environments

If `service.name` or `deployment.environment` are not set:

1. **Verify field names**: Check that your Seq logs include `Application` and `EnvironmentName` fields.
2. **Review transform statements**: Ensure the transform processor is enabled in the pipeline.
3. **Check conditions**: The `where` clauses check for non-nil values. Verify these fields exist in your logs.

## Next Steps

Once your Seq logs are flowing to SigNoz:

- [Create dashboards](https://signoz.io/docs/dashboards/) with log-based panels to visualize your log data
- [Set up log-based alerts](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/log-based-alerts/) for error patterns and anomalies
- [Configure log pipelines](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/introduction/) for advanced log processing and parsing
- [Explore log fields](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/logs_fields/) to understand how to query and filter your logs effectively

## Summary

This approach allows you to migrate your historical Seq logs to SigNoz without requiring any changes to your application code. The OpenTelemetry Collector acts as an intermediary processing layer that:

1. Reads exported Seq JSON logs from disk
2. Parses the Seq-specific JSON structure
3. Maps Seq fields to OpenTelemetry semantic conventions
4. Sends processed logs to SigNoz for storage and analysis

You can continue to export logs from Seq periodically and process them with this same configuration, or transition to sending logs directly from your applications to SigNoz using [OpenTelemetry instrumentation](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/).
