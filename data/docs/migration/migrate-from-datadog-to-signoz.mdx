SigNoz provides a unified OpenTelemetry-native solution for monitoring metrics, traces, and logs, giving you greater flexibility, control over your data, and freedom from vendor lock-in. This guide provides an overview of migrating your existing Datadog setup to SigNoz.

## Why Migrate to SigNoz?

- **Open Source & Open Standards**: SigNoz is open-source and built natively on OpenTelemetry, ensuring you are not locked into proprietary agents or data formats.
- **Data Control**: Full ownership and privacy of your telemetry data
- **Cost Efficiency**: Predictable pricing without per-host or per-container fees
  - Read the pricing analysis: [SigNoz vs Datadog vs New Relic vs Grafana](https://signoz.io/blog/pricing-comparison-signoz-vs-datadog-vs-newrelic-vs-grafana/)
- **Unified Platform**: Single UI for metrics, traces, and logs with built-in correlation

## Migration Overview

Migrating from Datadog to SigNoz involves replacing Datadog agents and libraries with OpenTelemetry instrumentation. The process can be done incrementally—you can migrate one signal type at a time while running both platforms in parallel.

### Migration Paths

| Signal | Guide | Key Changes |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Metrics** | [Migrate Metrics](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-datadog/metrics/) | Replace Datadog Agent with OTel Collector, migrate DogStatsD to OTel SDK |
| **Traces/APM** | [Migrate Traces](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-datadog/traces/) | Replace dd-trace libraries with OpenTelemetry SDKs |
| **Logs** | [Migrate Logs](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-datadog/logs/) | Replace Datadog log forwarders with OTel Collector |
| **Dashboards** | [Migrate Dashboards](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-datadog/dashboards/) | Recreate dashboards using templates or Query Builder |
| **Alerts** | [Migrate Alerts](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-datadog/alerts/) | Map Datadog monitors to SigNoz alert types |

### Bridge Solution: Datadog Receiver

If you need to continue using Datadog Agent during migration, you can use the [Datadog Receiver](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-datadog/opentelemetry-datadog-receiver/) in the OpenTelemetry Collector. This allows you to receive Datadog Agent traffic and forward it to SigNoz without modifying your applications immediately.

## Key Differences: Datadog vs SigNoz

| Aspect | Datadog | SigNoz |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Instrumentation** | Proprietary dd-trace libraries | OpenTelemetry SDKs (open standard) |
| **Agent** | Datadog Agent | OpenTelemetry Collector |
| **Custom Metrics** | DogStatsD | OpenTelemetry SDK |
| **Query Language** | Datadog Query Language | PromQL, ClickHouse SQL, Query Builder |
| **Dashboards** | JSON (Datadog schema) | JSON (SigNoz schema) |
| **Storage** | Proprietary | ClickHouse (open source) |

## Migration Tools

### Automated Dashboard Migration

Try the [SigNoz Datadog Migration Tool](https://signoz.io/datadog-migration-tool/) to automatically translate Datadog dashboard JSON to SigNoz format. This provides a starting point for complex dashboards.

### Import Pre-built Dashboards

SigNoz provides ready-to-use dashboard templates in the [SigNoz Dashboards Repository](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards):

- MongoDB Metrics
- Redis Metrics  
- MySQL/PostgreSQL
- JVM Metrics
- And more...
