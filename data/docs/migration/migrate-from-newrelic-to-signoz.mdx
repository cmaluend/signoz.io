SigNoz provides a unified OpenTelemetry-native solution for monitoring metrics, traces/APM, and logs, allowing for greater flexibility and control over your data. This guide outlines the process of migrating your existing New Relic setup to SigNoz.

## Why Migrate to SigNoz?

While New Relic is a powerful platform, migrating to SigNoz offers several distinct advantages:

- **Open Source & Open Standards**: SigNoz is open-source and built natively on OpenTelemetry, ensuring you are not locked into proprietary agents or data formats.
- **Cost Efficiency**: SigNoz often provides significant cost savings, especially for high-volume data, with transparent pricing for both Cloud and Self-Hosted options.

- **Deployment Flexibility**: Choose between SigNoz Cloud for a managed experience or Self-Hosted for complete control over your data and infrastructure.

- Access to your New Relic account to view existing configurations.
- Permissions to modify your application's instrumentation and infrastructure configuration.
