---

Grafana dashboards need to be recreated in SigNoz due to differences in the dashboard JSON schemas between the platforms. However, SigNoz provides tools and templates to make this process smoother.

## Prerequisites

- A SigNoz account (SigNoz Cloud or Self-Hosted).
- Access to your existing Grafana dashboards (for reference).

## Migration Strategies

### Using Dashboard Templates

SigNoz provides several pre-built dashboard templates that match common Grafana dashboards:

1. **Find Template**  
   Browse the [SigNoz Dashboard Templates repository](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards) to find a matching dashboard.

2. **Import Dashboard**  
   - Navigate to **Dashboards** in SigNoz.
   - Click **+ New Dashboard**.
   - Click **Import JSON**.
   - Either paste the JSON content or upload the file from the repository.

### Creating Custom Dashboards

If there is no existing template, you can create a custom dashboard in SigNoz.

- Follow the [Manage Dashboards guide](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/#steps-to-create-a-custom-dashboard/) for step-by-step instructions.
- Use the **Query Builder** to replicate your PromQL queries from Grafana.

## Feature Comparison

### Dashboard Features

SigNoz supports essential dashboard features including:

- **[Variables](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-variables/)**: Create template variables for dynamic dashboards.
- **[Panel Types](https://signoz.io/docs/dashboards/panel-types/)**: Various visualization options (time series, bar charts, tables, etc.).
- **[Query Builder](https://signoz.io/docs/product-features/query-builder/)**: Construct queries visually or using PromQL.

### Panel Types

## Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

You can manage your dashboards as code using the [SigNoz Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SigNoz/signoz/latest/docs). This allows you to version control your dashboards and automate their deployment, similar to how you might manage Grafana dashboards with Terraform.
