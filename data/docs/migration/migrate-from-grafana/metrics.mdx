title: Migrate Metrics from LGTM Stack
description: Learn how to migrate your metrics from Prometheus/Mimir (LGTM Stack) to SigNoz using OpenTelemetry.

## Overview

This guide walks you through migrating metrics from Prometheus, Mimir, or Grafana Cloud to SigNoz. You will:

1. Inventory your current metric sources
2. Set up the OpenTelemetry Collector
3. Configure receivers for your existing exporters
4. Validate metrics are flowing correctly

SigNoz supports Prometheus metrics natively, so migration typically involves pointing your existing exporters to the OpenTelemetry Collector or using the Collector to scrape your targets.

<KeyPointCallout title="Using self-hosted SigNoz?" defaultCollapsed={true}>
Most steps are identical. To adapt this guide, update the endpoint and remove the ingestion key header as shown in [Cloud → Self-Hosted](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/cloud-vs-self-hosted/#cloud-to-self-hosted).
</KeyPointCallout>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A SigNoz account ([Cloud](https://signoz.io/teams/)) or a running SigNoz instance (Self-Hosted)
- Access to your Prometheus/Mimir configuration (`prometheus.yml` or Grafana Agent config)
- Administrative access to deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector

## Step 1: Assess Your Current Metrics

Before migrating, list what you are currently collecting.

### List Your Metric Jobs

Run this PromQL query in Grafana (against your Prometheus/Mimir datasource) to see active jobs:

```promql
count({__name__=~".+"}) by (job)
```

This will give you a list of jobs (e.g., `node_exporter`, `kubernetes-pods`, `myapp`) and the number of series for each.

### Categorize Your Sources

Group your metrics by how they are collected:

| Source Type | Migration Path |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Prometheus Exporters** | `node_exporter`, `postgres_exporter`, etc. | [Use Prometheus Receiver](#from-prometheus-exporters) |
| **Application Metrics** | `/metrics` endpoint on your app | [Use Prometheus Receiver](#from-application-metrics) |
| **Grafana Agent** | Using Grafana Agent for collection | [Migrate to OTel Collector](#from-grafana-agent) |

## Step 2: Set Up the OpenTelemetry Collector

Most migration paths require the OpenTelemetry Collector.

1. [Install the OpenTelemetry Collector](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/get-started/) in your environment.
2. Configure the OTLP exporter to send metrics to SigNoz Cloud.

## Step 3: Migrate Each Metric Source

Work through each source type from your inventory.

### From Prometheus Exporters

If you have existing Prometheus exporters running (like `node_exporter`), you can configure the OpenTelemetry Collector to scrape them just like Prometheus did.

1. **Copy Scrape Configs**: Take the `scrape_configs` section from your `prometheus.yml`.
2. **Add to Collector**: Paste them into the `prometheus` receiver in `otel-collector-config.yaml`.

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'node-exporter'
          scrape_interval: 60s
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:9100']
```

3. **Enable in Pipeline**:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      # Ensure 'prometheus' is in this list
      receivers: [otlp, prometheus]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

For more details on configuring the Prometheus receiver, see [Prometheus Metrics in SigNoz](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/prometheus-metrics/).

### Replace Prometheus Exporters with OpenTelemetry Receivers

While the Prometheus Receiver allows you to continue using your existing Prometheus exporters, **we highly recommend migrating to native OpenTelemetry receivers** for many common systems and services. These provide a more direct integration with the OpenTelemetry ecosystem.

Here are some common Prometheus exporters and their OpenTelemetry equivalents:

| Prometheus Exporter | OpenTelemetry Receiver | Description |
|---------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| node_exporter | [hostmetrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver) | Collects system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network) |
| mysqld_exporter | [mysqld](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/mysqlreceiver) | Collects MySQL server metrics |
| redis_exporter | [redis](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/redisreceiver) | Collects Redis metrics |
| mongodb_exporter | [mongodb](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/mongodbreceiver) | Collects MongoDB metrics |
| postgres_exporter | [postgresql](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/postgresqlreceiver) | Collects PostgreSQL metrics |
| kafka_exporter | [kafka](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/kafkametricsreceiver) | Collects Kafka metrics |
| nginx_exporter | [nginx](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/nginxreceiver) | Collects NGINX metrics |

SigNoz supports all the receivers that are listed in the [OpenTelemetry Registry](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/?component=receiver). To configure a new metric receiver, follow these instructions [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/otel-metrics-receivers/#steps).

### From Application Metrics

If your applications expose a `/metrics` endpoint (common in Go, Java, Python apps using Prometheus client libraries):

1. **Add Scrape Job**: Add a job to the `prometheus` receiver to scrape your app.

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'my-app'
          scrape_interval: 30s
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['app-host:8080']
```

### From Grafana Agent

Grafana Agent is based on the Prometheus and OpenTelemetry Collector codebases. Migrating to the official OpenTelemetry Collector is usually straightforward.

1. **Identify Receivers**: Check your Grafana Agent config for `integrations` or `metrics` sections.
2. **Map to OTel**:
   - `node_exporter` integration -> `hostmetrics` receiver or `prometheus` receiver scraping `node_exporter`.
   - `prometheus.scrape` -> `prometheus` receiver.
   - `otlp` -> `otlp` receiver.

Refer to [OpenTelemetry Metrics Receivers](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/otel-metrics-receivers/) for more details.

### Finding More Metric Sources

For a complete list of all supported metric collection methods, see [Send Metrics to SigNoz](https://signoz.io/docs/metrics-management/send-metrics/).

### Switching to Native OTel Metrics

For new applications, we recommend using OpenTelemetry SDKs directly instead of Prometheus client libraries. This avoids the need for scraping and provides better context (exemplars).

See [Instrumentation Guides](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/) for your language.

## Validate

Compare your SigNoz metrics against your original inventory.

### Check Metrics Are Arriving

1. In SigNoz, navigate to **Metrics** in the left sidebar.
2. Use the **List View** to browse available metrics.
3. Click a metric name to see its attributes and values.

## Troubleshooting
</ToggleHeading>

### Metrics not appearing in SigNoz

1. **Check Collector status**: Verify the OpenTelemetry Collector is running.
2. **Verify endpoint**: Confirm `https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443` matches your account region.
3. **Check ingestion key**: Ensure `signoz-ingestion-key` header is set correctly.
4. **Check scrape targets**: Look at Collector logs to see if Prometheus scrapes are failing (connection refused, timeout).

### Missing attributes on metrics

If metrics appear but lack expected labels:

1. **Check relabel configs**: Ensure you aren't dropping labels in your scrape config.
2. **Verify resource attributes**: Ensure `service.name` and other resource attributes are set.

### Metric values don't match

1. **Align time ranges**: Ensure both queries cover the exact same period.
2. **Match aggregations**: PromQL `rate()` vs `irate()` can produce different results.
