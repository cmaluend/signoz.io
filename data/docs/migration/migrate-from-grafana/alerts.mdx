While migrating your observability stack from the LGTM stack to SigNoz, you'll also need to recreate your alerts in SigNoz's alert management system.

## Prerequisites

- A SigNoz account (SigNoz Cloud or Self-Hosted).
- List of existing alert rules and notification channels from Grafana/AlertManager.

## Migration Steps

### Setting Up Notification Channels

Before migrating your alerts to SigNoz, you will need to set up the notification channels you want to use.

If the notification channel you need is not listed, you can use the **Webhook** channel to integrate with other tools.

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Alerts Notification Channel documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/notification-channel).

### Setting Up Alert Rules

SigNoz provides a comprehensive alert management system. You can migrate your existing rules by mapping them to the corresponding alert types in SigNoz:

#### Alert Rule Mapping

| Grafana / Prometheus Rule | SigNoz Alert Type | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Metric Alert** (PromQL) | [Metric Alert](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/metrics-based-alerts/) | Supports raw PromQL. Direct copy-paste often works. |
| **Log Alert** (LogQL) | [Log Alert](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/log-based-alerts/) | Use Query Builder to recreate LogQL filters. |
| **Trace Alert** (Tempo) | [Trace Alert](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/trace-based-alerts/) | Alert on latency, error rates, or span attributes. |
| **Anomaly Detection** | [Anomaly Alert](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/anomaly-based-alerts/) | Detects deviations without static thresholds. |
| **Recording Rules** | Not directly supported | Use scheduled queries or materialization (ClickHouse) if needed. |

### Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

If you define alert rules as code in your LGTM Stack (either as Prometheus rules or using the Grafana Terraform provider), you can continue using the same approach while migrating to SigNoz.

Use the [SigNoz Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SigNoz/signoz/latest/docs) to manage your alerts and notification channels programmatically.

## Troubleshooting
</ToggleHeading>

### Alerts not triggering

- **Check Query**: Verify that the PromQL query returns data in the Query Builder.
- **Check Thresholds**: Ensure the threshold conditions are met.
- **Check Notification Channel**: Send a test alert to verify the channel configuration.
