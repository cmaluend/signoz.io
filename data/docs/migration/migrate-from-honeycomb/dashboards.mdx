This guide helps you migrate your Honeycomb dashboards to SigNoz by translating queries and using enhanced visualization options.

## Prerequisites

- A SigNoz account (SigNoz Cloud or Self-Hosted).
- Access to your existing Honeycomb dashboards (for reference).

## Migration Strategies

### Using Dashboard Templates

Start by checking if a pre-built template matches your needs.

1. **Find Template**  
   Browse the [SigNoz Dashboard Templates repository](https://signoz.io/docs/dashboards/dashboard-templates/overview/) to find a matching dashboard.

2. **Import Dashboard**  
   - Navigate to **Dashboards** in SigNoz.
   - Click **+ New Dashboard**.
   - Click **Import JSON**.
   - Either paste the JSON content or upload the file from the repository.

### Creating Custom Dashboards

If no template fits, you can create a custom dashboard in SigNoz.

- Follow the [Manage Dashboards guide](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/#steps-to-create-a-custom-dashboard/) for step-by-step instructions.
- Use the **Query Builder** to replicate your queries from Honeycomb.

## Feature Comparison

### Panel Types

SigNoz supports various panel types. Here's how they map to Honeycomb:

| Panel Type        | Honeycomb | SigNoz | Notes                                            |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Time Series       | ✓         | ✓      | Both platforms support time series visualization |
| Table             | ✓         | ✓      | Both support tabular data display                |
| Bar Chart         | -         | ✓      | Enhanced visualization option in SigNoz          |
| Pie Chart         | -         | ✓      | Enhanced visualization option in SigNoz          |
| Value/Single Stat | -         | ✓      | Single value display with thresholds             |
| Heatmap           | ✓         | -      | Use histogram metrics as alternative             |

| SLO Panel         | ✓         | -      | Recreate using custom alert rules                |

### Query Translation

Honeycomb uses a proprietary query syntax, while SigNoz supports PromQL (metrics), ClickHouse SQL (logs/traces) and Query Builder.

| Honeycomb Query            | SigNoz Equivalent          | Notes                            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `COUNT`                    | `count()`                  | Total occurrences                |
| `COUNT WHERE condition`    | `count()` with filters     | Use search syntax for conditions |
| `AVG(field)`               | `avg(field)`               | Mean values calculation          |
| `P95(field)`, `P99(field)` | `p95(field)`, `p99(field)` | Percentile functions             |
| `GROUP BY field`           | Group By: `field`          | Use Group By dropdown            |

Use the [Query Builder](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder-v5/) to construct queries visually.

## Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

You can manage your dashboards as code using the [SigNoz Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SigNoz/signoz/latest/docs). This allows you to version control your dashboards and automate their deployment.
