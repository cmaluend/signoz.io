This guide explains how to migrate observability data from Honeycomb to SigNoz by updating your OpenTelemetry configuration.

## Prerequisites

- Active [SigNoz Cloud](https://signoz.io/teams/) account or [self-hosted SigNoz](https://signoz.io/docs/install/self-host/) instance.
- Access to your application's OpenTelemetry configuration.

## Legacy SDK Migration

If you are using Honeycomb's legacy SDKs (Beelines or Honeycomb Distributions), you must first migrate to OpenTelemetry:

- <a href="https://docs.honeycomb.io/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/recommended-migrations/migrate-from-honeycomb-distributions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Migrate from Honeycomb Distributions</a>

Once you have switched to OpenTelemetry, proceed with the configuration below.

## OpenTelemetry Configuration

Since both Honeycomb and SigNoz use OpenTelemetry, migrating involves pointing your OTLP endpoint to SigNoz.

<KeyPointCallout title="Using self-hosted SigNoz?" defaultCollapsed={true}>
Most steps are identical. To adapt this guide, update the endpoint and remove the ingestion key header as shown in [Cloud → Self-Hosted](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/cloud-vs-self-hosted/#cloud-to-self-hosted).
</KeyPointCallout>

### Step 1: Obtain Connection Details

1. Log into your [SigNoz Cloud account](https://signoz.io/teams/).
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Ingestion Settings**.
3. Note your **Ingestion Key** and **Ingestion URL**.

### Step 2: Update OpenTelemetry Configuration

Set the following environment variables for your application:

```bash
# Replace with your SigNoz cloud region
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"

# Replace with your SigNoz ingestion key
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY"
```

If you are using an **OpenTelemetry Collector**, update your exporter configuration:

```yaml
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
    headers:
      signoz-ingestion-key: "SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY"
    tls:
      insecure: false
```

Replace the following placeholders:
- `<region>`: Your SigNoz Cloud region (e.g., `us`, `eu`, `in`).
- `SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY`: Your SigNoz Ingestion Key.

### Step 3: Verify Data

Check the SigNoz dashboard to ensure traces/APM, logs, and metrics are arriving.

## Configure Signal Correlation

SigNoz automatically correlates logs with traces when they share `trace_id` and `span_id`.

- **Automatic:** Use OpenTelemetry SDKs that inject trace context into logs.
- **Manual:** Ensure your logging libraries include `trace_id` and `span_id` fields.

## Configure Additional Metrics

You may need to configure additional metrics sources if they were handled differently in Honeycomb.

### Enable Prometheus Receiver

To scrape existing Prometheus endpoints, enable the Prometheus receiver in your SigNoz Collector.

See the [Prometheus Metrics guide](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/prometheus-metrics/) for full details.

## Troubleshooting
</ToggleHeading>

- **401/403 errors when exporting**: Verify `signoz-ingestion-key` header value and that the key is active in SigNoz Cloud settings.
- **TLS or connection errors**: Ensure the endpoint uses `https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443` and that `tls.insecure` remains `false`.
- **Metrics or logs missing but traces present**: Confirm all three pipelines include the SigNoz exporter and that services emit those signals. Check collector logs for dropped data.
- **High latency or backpressure**: Add the `batch` processor and enable retry queue in the exporter to prevent data loss under load.
