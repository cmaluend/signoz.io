While migrating your observability stack from New Relic to SigNoz, you'll also need to recreate your alerts in SigNoz's alert management system.

## Prerequisites

- A SigNoz account (SigNoz Cloud or Self-Hosted).
- List of existing alert policies and notification channels from New Relic.

## Migration Steps

### Setting Up Notification Channels

Before migrating your alerts to SigNoz, you will need to set up the notification channels you want to use.

### Supported Notification Channels

Below is a list of notification channels supported by New Relic and SigNoz:

| Notification Channel | New Relic             | SigNoz               |
|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Email                | ✓                     | ✓                    |

| VictorOps/Splunk     | ✓                     | Via Webhook          |

If the notification channel you need is not listed, you can use the **Webhook** channel to integrate with other tools.

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Alerts Notification Channel documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/notification-channel).

### Setting Up Alert Rules

SigNoz provides a comprehensive alert management system. You can migrate your existing rules by mapping them to the corresponding alert types in SigNoz:

#### Alert Rule Mapping

| New Relic Alert Type | SigNoz Alert Type | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NRQL Alert** (Metrics) | [Metric Alert](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/metrics-based-alerts/) | Convert NRQL queries to PromQL. |
| **NRQL Alert** (Logs) | [Log Alert](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/log-based-alerts/) | Use Query Builder to recreate log filters. |
| **NRQL Alert** (Traces) | [Trace Alert](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/trace-based-alerts/) | Alert on latency, error rates, or span attributes. |
| **Anomaly Alert** | [Anomaly Alert](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/anomaly-based-alerts/) | Detects deviations without static thresholds. |

### Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

If you define alert rules as code in New Relic (for example, using the New Relic Terraform provider), you can continue using the same approach while migrating to SigNoz.

Use the [SigNoz Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SigNoz/signoz/latest/docs) to manage your alerts and notification channels programmatically.

## Validate

To confirm that your alerts are migrated correctly:

1. Test alerts by temporarily lowering thresholds or triggering test conditions.
2. Verify that notifications are sent to the configured channels.
3. Monitor for any missed alerts during the transition period.

## Troubleshooting
</ToggleHeading>

### Alerts not triggering

- **Check Data**: Ensure that the data (metrics, logs, traces) required for the alert is being received by SigNoz.
- **Verify Query**: Use the Query Builder to verify that your alert query returns the expected values.
- **Check Thresholds**: Ensure that the threshold conditions are met.
- **Evaluation Interval**: Check the evaluation interval and ensure the condition persists long enough to trigger the alert.

### Notifications not received

- **Test Channel**: Use the "Test" button in the alert channel configuration to verify connectivity.
- **Check Spam Folder**: If using email, check your spam folder.
- **Verify Webhook URL**: If using webhooks, ensure the URL is correct and accessible from the SigNoz instance.
