title: Migrate Dashboards from New Relic
description: Learn how to migrate your New Relic dashboards to SigNoz using templates or custom creation.
doc_type: howto
---

New Relic dashboards need to be recreated in SigNoz due to differences in the dashboard JSON schemas between the platforms. However, SigNoz provides tools and templates to make this process smoother.

## Prerequisites

- A SigNoz account (SigNoz Cloud or Self-Hosted).
- Access to your existing New Relic dashboards (for reference).

## Migration Strategies

### Using Dashboard Templates

SigNoz provides several pre-built dashboard templates that match common New Relic dashboards:

1. **Find Template**  
   Browse the [SigNoz Dashboard Templates repository](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards) to find a matching dashboard.


   <Admonition type="info">
   SigNoz provides a built-in [Infrastructure Monitoring module](https://signoz.io/docs/infrastructure-monitoring/overview/) that covers both host and Kubernetes monitoring. The above dashboards are optional and can be used for additional customization if needed.

2. **Import Dashboard**  
   - Navigate to **Dashboards** in SigNoz.
   - Click **+ New Dashboard**.
   - Click **Import JSON**.
   - Either paste the JSON content or upload the file from the repository.

### Creating Custom Dashboards

If there is no existing template, you can create a custom dashboard in SigNoz.

- Follow the [Manage Dashboards guide](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/#steps-to-create-a-custom-dashboard/) for step-by-step instructions.
- Use the **Query Builder** to replicate your NRQL queries

### Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

You can manage your dashboards as code using the [SigNoz Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SigNoz/signoz/latest/docs). This allows you to version control your dashboards and automate their deployment, similar to how you might manage New Relic dashboards with Terraform.

## Feature Comparison

### Dashboard Features

SigNoz supports essential dashboard features including:

- **[Variables](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-variables/)**: Create template variables for dynamic dashboards.
- **[Panel Types](https://signoz.io/docs/dashboards/panel-types/)**: Various visualization options (time series, bar charts, tables, etc.).
- **[Query Builder](https://signoz.io/docs/product-features/query-builder/)**: Construct queries visually or using PromQL/ClickHouse SQL.

### Panel Types

SigNoz supports most of the common panel types found in New Relic:

## Validate

To confirm that your dashboards are migrated correctly:

1. Navigate to **Dashboards** in SigNoz.
2. Open your newly created dashboard.
3. Verify that all panels are populating with data.
4. Check that variables are working as expected.

## Troubleshooting

### Empty Charts

If your charts are empty:
- Verify that the metrics used in the query are actually being received by SigNoz.
- Check the time range of the dashboard.
- Ensure that any variables used in the query have valid values selected.

### Query Errors

If you see query errors:
- Check the syntax of your PromQL or ClickHouse SQL query.
- Use the Query Builder to construct valid queries interactively.
- Verify that the metric names and labels used in the query are correct.
