### Q. How to view metrics?

You can explore all ingested metrics in the [Metrics Explorer](/docs/metrics-management/metrics-explorer/).
Or you can also [Add a panel](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-panels/) in a Dashboard to view the metrics in dropdown.

### Why I can't see my metric 'x'?

When you can't see specific metrics in SigNoz, this is often caused by a temporality mismatch. This occurs when a single metric sends data with different temporalities (delta and cumulative), causing the query builder to produce unpredictable results or lose access to previous metrics.

**To resolve this issue:**

1. **Keep temporality unchanged** - Ensure your metrics maintain consistent temporality throughout their lifecycle
2. **Contact support for immediate resolution** - If you're experiencing this issue, the SigNoz team can quickly restore access to your metrics from their side
3. **Consider using ClickHouse queries as a workaround** - Direct ClickHouse queries can bypass temporality issues since they either ignore temporality information or make assumptions about it

**Important considerations when using ClickHouse queries:**

- While ClickHouse queries can work around temporality issues, you'll miss out on performance optimizations
- SigNoz uses pre-aggregated tables to accelerate queries over extended time periods, which automatically redirect based on queried time ranges through the query builder
- ClickHouse queries don't benefit from these pre-aggregated tables because they have different structures and columns
- When metrics contain mixed temporalities, you'll need to write complex queries that merge delta and cumulative values to retrieve complete data

**Best practice:**

Maintain consistent temporality in your metrics to avoid these issues and ensure optimal performance through the query builder interface.
