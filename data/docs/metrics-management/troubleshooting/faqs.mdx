### Q. How to view metrics?

You can explore all ingested metrics in the [Metrics Explorer](/docs/metrics-management/metrics-explorer/).
Or you can also [Add a panel](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-panels/) in a Dashboard to view the metrics in dropdown.

### Why I can't see my metric 'x'?

When you can't see specific metrics in SigNoz, this is often caused by a temporality mismatch. This occurs when a single metric sends data with different temporalities (delta and cumulative), causing the query builder to produce unpredictable results or lose access to previous metrics.

**To resolve this issue:**

1. **Keep temporality unchanged** - Ensure your metrics maintain consistent temporality throughout their lifecycle
2. **Contact support for immediate resolution** - If you're experiencing this issue, the SigNoz team can quickly restore access to your metrics from their side
3. **Consider using ClickHouse queries as a workaround** - Direct ClickHouse queries can bypass temporality issues since they either ignore temporality information or make assumptions about it

**Important considerations when using ClickHouse queries:**

- While ClickHouse queries can work around temporality issues, you'll miss out on performance optimizations
- SigNoz uses pre-aggregated tables to accelerate queries over extended time periods, which automatically redirect based on queried time ranges through the query builder
- ClickHouse queries don't benefit from these pre-aggregated tables because they have different structures and columns
- When metrics contain mixed temporalities, you'll need to write complex queries that merge delta and cumulative values to retrieve complete data

**Best practice:**

Maintain consistent temporality in your metrics to avoid these issues and ensure optimal performance through the query builder interface.

### Q. Why do my custom rate queries differ from the Services dashboard?

If you're trying to recreate the rate metrics shown in the Services dashboard using custom queries in the Metrics section, you may notice that your numbers don't match. This is because the Services dashboard has specific filtering that affects the calculations.

**Understanding the difference**

The rate table under Services only considers **top-level operations**, which is why there's a discrepancy between what you see in the Services dashboard and what you get when querying `signoz_calls_total` directly with Rate and Sum functions.

When you query `signoz_calls_total` in the Metrics section, you're getting data from all operations, including nested or child operations. However, the Services dashboard filters this data to show only top-level operations, resulting in different (typically lower) values.

**Getting accurate Service-level metrics**

To recreate the same metrics you see in the Services dashboard, you'll need to use queries that filter for top-level operations only.

For reference queries and examples, you can import the official [APM Metrics dashboard template](/docs/dashboards/dashboard-templates/apm-metrics) from the SigNoz documentation. This will provide you with the proper query structure to match the Services dashboard calculations.

For more information about how APM metrics are generated from span data, see [Guide to APM metrics](/docs/traces-management/guides/apm-metrics).
