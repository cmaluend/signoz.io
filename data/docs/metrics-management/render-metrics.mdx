This document explains how to send metrics from Render workspace using Metrics Streams.

<Admonition type="info">
Render Metrics Streams require a **Professional plan** for Render.
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- Render workspace with **Professional** plan or higher
- SigNoz Cloud account 
- A running Render service (web service or background worker). Static sites are not supported.

## Step 1: Get SigNoz Cloud Ingestion Details

1. In SigNoz, go to **Settings → Ingestion**
2. Copy your **Ingestion Endpoint** and **Ingestion Key**

## Step 2: Create a Metrics Stream Destination in Render

1. In Render Dashboard, open **Integrations → Observability**
2. Under **Metrics Stream**, click **Add destination**
3. Choose provider: **SigNoz**
4. Enter:
   - **Endpoint**: Your SigNoz ingestion endpoint
   - **Ingestion Key**: Your SigNoz ingestion key
5. Save

Render will begin streaming metrics for all supported services in your workspace.

## Step 3: Verify Metrics in SigNoz

1. Go to **Metrics Explorer** in SigNoz
2. Search for metrics starting with `render.service.`

Common metrics you should see:
- `render.service.http.requests.total`
- `render.service.http.requests.latency`
- `render.service.cpu.time`
- `render.service.memory.rss`
- `render.service.memory.usage`

<Admonition type="tip">
If you don't see metrics, widen the time range and generate some traffic to your Render service.
</Admonition>

## Notes

- Metrics streams include service metrics for your workspace; static sites are excluded.
- Some HTTP request metric features are gated behind Professional workspaces.
