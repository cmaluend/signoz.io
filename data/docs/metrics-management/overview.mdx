Metrics provide numerical data over time to help you monitor application and infrastructure behavior. SigNoz enables you to collect, query, and visualize metrics from diverse sources, including OpenTelemetry SDKs, the OTel Collector, and Prometheus.

Use this section to find guides for sending data, exploring metrics, and setting up dashboards and alerts.

## Key capabilities

- **Flexible ingestion**: Collect metrics from applications, infrastructure, and existing Prometheus setups. SigNoz also derives APM metrics from traces automatically.
- **Interactive exploration**: Use the [Metrics Explorer](https://signoz.io/docs/metrics-management/metrics-explorer/) to query and visualize data with a visual builder or advanced query languages like PromQL and ClickHouse SQL.
- **Dashboards and Alerts**: Build custom [dashboards](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/) or use pre-built templates. Configure [alerts](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/metrics-based-alerts/) to notify your team of anomalies.
- **Unified context**: Correlate metrics with traces and logs for faster root cause analysis.
