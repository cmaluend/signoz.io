## Overview

Metrics billing is based on **cardinality** - the number of unique time series created by your metrics. Understanding how attributes affect cardinality is key to managing costs effectively.

## How Attributes Affect Billing

There are two types of attributes that affect your metrics differently:

1. **Identifying attributes** - These create new time series and contribute to cost. For example, adding a new `host.name` creates a new series.
2. **Non-identifying/descriptive attributes** - These enrich existing metrics without creating new series. Examples include host family or EC2 tags.

You can add as many non-identifying attributes as needed without additional cost, but each new identifying attribute with unique values increases your bill, often exponentially.

## Common Cost Drivers

### High Cardinality Attributes

Avoid including random IDs or unique identifiers in your metric attributes. For example, instead of:

```
/bitcoin-mainnet-esplora/scripthash/20fd0a38027a2eeb14fd50fcbd94934f832bef4cc279958c30c72704338eb065/txs
```

Use a templated approach:

```
/bitcoin-mainnet-esplora/scripthash/${id}/txs
```

### Histogram Metrics

Histogram metrics are particularly costly because:

1. **Bucket configuration** - Each bucket distribution creates a separate series. Optimize your bucket configuration based on your workload's latency patterns.
2. **Cumulative nature** - With cumulative histogram metrics, values continue to be sent even when there's no recent activity, especially problematic when combined with high-cardinality attributes like method names containing IDs.

## Cost Reduction Strategies

### 1. Remove or Template High-Cardinality Attributes

Replace unique IDs with templated values to reduce the number of unique time series being created.

### 2. Optimize Histogram Buckets

Reduce the number of buckets while maintaining meaningful data. See [Configure Custom Buckets](https://signoz.io/docs/metrics-management/configure-custom-buckets/) for more details.

### 3. Implement Sampling

Reduce the volume of metrics sent from your application. This directly reduces the number of data points ingested.

### 4. Review Attribute Necessity

Ensure all identifying attributes are essential for your monitoring needs. Remove any attributes that don't provide actionable insights.

### 5. Aggregate or Drop Metrics

Consider using the following techniques:

- **Aggregate labels** - Use the [MetricsTransform Processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/metricstransformprocessor/README.md) to aggregate metrics, which actually reduces cardinality and sample count.
- **Drop entire metrics** - See [How to Drop and Filter OpenTelemetry Metrics](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/drop-metrics/) to remove unnecessary metrics entirely.

<Admonition type="warning">
Note that simply dropping metric labels/attributes does **not** reduce cardinality or costs. See [Dropping Metric Labels](https://signoz.io/docs/metrics-management/dropping-metric-labels/) for a detailed explanation of why this doesn't work and what to do instead.

## Monitoring Your Costs

Use the [Cost Meter](https://signoz.io/docs/cost-meter/overview/) to:

- Monitor costs across different telemetry signals
- Understand the cost breakdown and key contributors
- Track metric datapoint ingestion over time
- Set up [alerts](https://signoz.io/docs/cost-meter/alerts/) to notify you when costs exceed thresholds
