title: Monitor EKS Fargate with SigNoz
description: Collect logs, metrics, and traces from EKS Fargate pods using OpenTelemetry sidecar collectors.
doc_type: howto
---

## Overview

EKS Fargate runs Kubernetes pods on serverless compute without exposing the underlying node. Because node-level DaemonSets and host mounts are not supported on Fargate, you need to deploy an OpenTelemetry Collector as a sidecar container within each pod you want to observe.

<Admonition type="info">
This guide is specific to **EKS Fargate**. For standard EKS clusters running on EC2 nodes, see [Monitor EKS EC2 Nodes](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/eks/eks-ec2-nodes/) which uses the K8s-Infra Helm chart with DaemonSet agents.
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- An EKS cluster with Fargate profiles configured
- SigNoz Cloud account or Self-Hosted SigNoz
- `kubectl` access to your cluster
- Helm installed (for k8s-infra cluster-level components)

## Why Sidecar on Fargate?

- **DaemonSets are not supported** on Fargate nodes
- **HostPath mounts and host network/ports** are not available
- The sidecar provides a **local OTLP endpoint** (`localhost`) for your app to send traces, metrics, and logs

### Architecture

```
Pod (Fargate)
├─ app container(s)
│  └─ sends OTLP telemetry data to the sidecar
└─ otel-collector sidecar
   ├─ receives OTLP data from the app container(s)
   └─ exports telemetry to SigNoz (cloud or self-hosted)
```

## What You Can Collect

| Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Kubelet Metrics** | Pod and container resource utilization from the Kubelet API |
| **Container Logs** | Logs generated by containers in the pod |
| **Traces** | Distributed traces from instrumented applications |

## Setup

For complete setup instructions, follow the [EKS Fargate Installation Guide](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/k8s/serverless/install/).

The setup involves:

1. **Install k8s-infra Helm chart** for cluster-level collection (with `otelAgent` disabled for Fargate)
2. **Create ConfigMaps** for the sidecar collector configuration and in-cluster kubeconfig
3. **Set up RBAC** (ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding) for kubelet stats access
4. **Add the sidecar container** to your application Deployment/Pod specs
5. **Apply the manifests** and verify data in SigNoz

## Validate

Once set up, verify your data appears in SigNoz:

- **Logs**: Navigate to **Logs** tab → [Logs Explorer](https://signoz.io/docs/product-features/logs-explorer/)
- **Metrics**: Navigate to **Infrastructure Monitoring** → **Kubernetes** to see pods and containers
- **Traces**: Navigate to **Traces** tab to see distributed traces from your applications
