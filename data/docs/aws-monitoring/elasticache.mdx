## Overview

Amazon ElastiCache provides managed Redis and Memcached clusters. SigNoz helps you monitor cache performance, memory utilization, and replication health.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- SigNoz Cloud account or Self-Hosted SigNoz

## One-Click Integration

<Admonition type="info">
One-Click Integration is available for **SigNoz Cloud** only and includes pre-built dashboards. This method uses AWS CloudFormation and CloudWatch, which may incur additional AWS charges.
</Admonition>

### Step 1: Connect Your AWS Account

Follow the [One-Click AWS Integrations Guide](https://signoz.io/docs/integrations/aws/elasticache/) to:
1. Deploy the CloudFormation stack
2. Connect your AWS account to SigNoz

### Step 2: Enable ElastiCache Monitoring

Once connected, SigNoz will auto-discover your ElastiCache clusters and begin collecting CloudWatch metrics.

### What's Collected

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `CPUUtilization` | CPU usage percentage |
| `FreeableMemory` | Available memory |
| `CacheHits` / `CacheMisses` | Cache hit/miss counts |
| `CacheHitRate` | Hit rate percentage |
| `CurrConnections` | Current client connections |
| `ReplicationLag` | Replication delay (Redis) |
| `Evictions` | Evicted items count |

### Pre-built Dashboards

Navigate to **Dashboards** and search for "ElastiCache" or "Redis" to find automatically imported dashboards.

## Manual Setup

<Admonition type="info">
Manual setup works for both **SigNoz Cloud** and **Self-Hosted**. You'll need to set up your own dashboards.
</Admonition>

For comprehensive ElastiCache monitoring, see the detailed guide:

[**AWS ElastiCache Redis Integration**](https://signoz.io/docs/integrations/aws-elasticache-redis/)

This guide covers:
- Setting up the Prometheus CloudWatch Exporter for AWS metrics
- Configuring the Redis receiver for native Redis metrics
- Collecting ElastiCache logs via CloudWatch
- Pre-built dashboard JSON files
