## One-Click Integration

<Admonition type="info">
One-Click Integration is available for **SigNoz Cloud** only and includes pre-built dashboards. This method uses AWS CloudFormation and CloudWatch, which may incur additional AWS charges.
</Admonition>

### Step 1: Connect Your AWS Account

Follow the [One-Click AWS Integrations Guide](https://signoz.io/docs/integrations/aws/msk/) to:
1. Deploy the CloudFormation stack
2. Connect your AWS account to SigNoz

### Step 2: Enable MSK Monitoring

Once connected, SigNoz will auto-discover your MSK clusters and begin collecting CloudWatch metrics.

### What's Collected

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `BytesInPerSec` | Incoming bytes per second |
| `BytesOutPerSec` | Outgoing bytes per second |
| `MessagesInPerSec` | Incoming messages per second |
| `PartitionCount` | Number of partitions |
| `UnderReplicatedPartitions` | Under-replicated partitions |
| `OfflinePartitionsCount` | Offline partitions |
| `ActiveControllerCount` | Active controller count |

### Pre-built Dashboards

Navigate to **Dashboards** and search for "MSK" to find automatically imported dashboards.

## Manual Setup
