### Why doesn't my AWS metric have an average statistic form?

Some AWS metrics collected through CloudWatch may not always export an `average` statistic directly from the collector. This is because the OpenTelemetry Collector exports metrics using the statistic forms provided by AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams.

**Available metric forms:**

AWS CloudWatch provides the following statistic forms for most metrics:
- `min` - Minimum value
- `max` - Maximum value
- `sum` - Sum of all values
- `count` - Number of data points

**To calculate the average:**

You can calculate the average manually using the formula:

```
average = sum / count
```

This will give you the same result as the `average` statistic you would see in AWS CloudWatch console.

**Example: EC2 CPU Utilization**

For the `aws_EC2_CPUUtilization` metric:
1. Use the formula: `aws_EC2_CPUUtilization_sum / aws_EC2_CPUUtilization_count`
2. This calculates the average CPU utilization percentage
3. The result matches the `average` metric shown in CloudWatch

**Why this approach?**

The available metric forms (min/max/sum/count) follow the AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams standard. For detailed information about how these metrics are calculated and exported, refer to:
- [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-metric-streams.html)
- [AWS CloudWatch Statistics Definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Statistic)

This approach allows you to:
- Migrate alarms that previously used the average statistic in CloudWatch
- Create custom calculations and aggregations
- Maintain the same monitoring functionality across platforms
