## Overview

This guide explains how to collect application and server logs from your EC2 instances using the OpenTelemetry Collector.

<Admonition type="info">
This guide assumes you have already installed the OpenTelemetry Collector on your EC2 instance. If not, see [Install OpenTelemetry Collector on VM](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/).
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- A Linux-based EC2 instance
- OpenTelemetry Collector installed and running
- Access to modify the collector's configuration file (usually `config.yaml`)

## Setup

To collect logs from your EC2 instance, you will need to configure the `filelog` receiver in your OpenTelemetry Collector.

For complete configuration instructions, follow the **[Collect Logs from File](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/collect_logs_from_file/)** guide.

The setup involves:

1.  **Defining the input**: Specifying the path to your log files (e.g., `/var/log/myapp.log`) in the `filelog` receiver configuration.
2.  **Enabling the pipeline**: Adding the receiver to a logs pipeline in the `config.yaml` file.
3.  **Restarting the Collector**: Applying the new configuration.

## Validate

Once you have updated the configuration and restarted the collector:

1.  Generate some logs in your application or log file.
2.  Go to the **[Logs Explorer](https://signoz.io/docs/product-features/logs-explorer/)** in SigNoz.
3.  You should see your logs appearing. You can filter by `host.name` (which usually defaults to the EC2 instance ID or hostname) to find logs from this specific instance.
