## Overview

This documentation guides you through integrating AWS EC2 infrastructure metrics into SigNoz using the Hostmetrics receiver in OpenTelemetry Collector. 
The Hostmetrics receiver is designed to collect metrics about the host system from various sources. It supports various scrapers for collecting different metrics, 
including CPU, disk, load, filesystem, memory, network, paging, and process metrics.

## Manual Setup with OpenTelemetry

<Admonition type="info">
The manual setup using OpenTelemetry Hostmetrics receiver provides **comprehensive EC2 monitoring**, collecting detailed host metrics. This method works for both **SigNoz Cloud** and **Self-Hosted**.
</Admonition>

### Prerequisites

- An EC2 instance
- SSH Access to the instance

### Setup

To collect infrastructure metrics, you need to install the OpenTelemetry Collector on your EC2 instance. The collector's `hostmetrics` receiver is enabled by default in the SigNoz distribution.

Follow the **[Install OpenTelemetry Collector on VM](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/)** guide.

### What's Collected

| Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CPU** | Usage, load averages, utilization per core |
| **Memory** | Used, available, free, and cached memory |
| **Disk** | I/O operations, throughput, filesystem usage |
| **Network** | Bytes sent/received, packet drops, errors |

### Validate

Once installed, your EC2 infrastructure metrics will be visible in SigNoz:

1. Navigate to **Infrastructure Monitoring** -> **Hosts**.
2. You will see your EC2 instance listed.

## One-Click Integration

<Admonition type="info">
One-Click Integration is available for **SigNoz Cloud** only and includes pre-built dashboards. This method uses AWS CloudFormation and CloudWatch, which may incur additional AWS charges.
</Admonition>

### Step 1: Connect Your AWS Account

Follow the [One-Click AWS Integrations Guide](https://signoz.io/docs/integrations/aws/ec2/) to:
1. Deploy the CloudFormation stack
2. Connect your AWS account to SigNoz

### Step 2: Enable EC2 Monitoring

Once connected, SigNoz will auto-discover your EC2 instances and begin collecting CloudWatch metrics.

### What's Collected

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `CPUUtilization` | CPU usage percentage |
| `DiskReadBytes` | Disk read bytes |
| `DiskWriteBytes` | Disk write bytes |
| `NetworkIn` | Network bytes received |
| `NetworkOut` | Network bytes sent |
| `StatusCheckFailed` | Instance status check failures |

### Pre-built Dashboards

Navigate to **Dashboards** and search for "EC2" to find automatically imported dashboards.
