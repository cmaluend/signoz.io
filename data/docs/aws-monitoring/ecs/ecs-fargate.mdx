title: Monitor ECS Fargate with SigNoz
description: Collect logs, metrics, and traces from ECS Fargate services using OpenTelemetry sidecar collectors.
doc_type: howto
---

## Overview

ECS Fargate runs containers on serverless compute without exposing the underlying infrastructure. Because you don't have access to the host instances, you need to deploy an OpenTelemetry Collector as a sidecar container within each task you want to observe.

<Admonition type="info">
This guide is specific to **ECS Fargate**. For ECS clusters running on EC2 or External launch types, see [Monitor ECS EC2/External](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/ecs/ecs-ec2-external/) which uses a daemon service for host-level collection.

## Prerequisites

- An ECS cluster with Fargate launch type
- SigNoz Cloud account or Self-Hosted SigNoz
- AWS CLI access to update task definitions

## Why Sidecar on Fargate?

- **No host access**: Fargate abstracts the underlying infrastructure
- **No daemon services**: Cannot deploy cluster-wide agents like with EC2 launch type
- The sidecar provides a **local OTLP endpoint** (`localhost`) for your app to send traces, metrics, and logs

### Architecture

```
ECS Task (Fargate)
├─ app container(s)
│  └─ sends OTLP telemetry data to the sidecar
├─ signoz-collector sidecar
│  ├─ receives OTLP data from the app container(s)
│  ├─ collects container metrics via AWS ECS metadata
│  └─ exports telemetry to SigNoz (cloud or self-hosted)
└─ log-router (optional, for Fluent Bit log forwarding)
```

## What You Can Collect

| Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Container Metrics** | CPU, memory, network usage from ECS metadata |
| **Application Traces** | Distributed traces from instrumented applications |
| **Application Logs** | Logs forwarded via Fluent Bit log router |

## Setup

For complete setup instructions, follow the [ECS Sidecar Installation Guide](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/ecs/sidecar/install/).

The setup involves:

1. **Create OTel Collector config** in AWS Parameter Store
2. **Add the sidecar container** to your ECS task definition
3. **Update IAM roles** (Task Execution Role and Task Role) with required permissions
4. **Configure log routing** (optional, for application logs via Fluent Bit)
5. **Deploy the updated task definition** and verify data in SigNoz

## Validate

Once set up, verify your data appears in SigNoz:

- **Logs**: Navigate to **Logs** tab → [Logs Explorer](https://signoz.io/docs/product-features/logs-explorer/)
- **Metrics**: Navigate to **Metrics** tab → [Metrics Explorer](https://signoz.io/docs/metrics-management/overview/)
- **Traces**: Navigate to **Services** tab to see your instrumented applications
