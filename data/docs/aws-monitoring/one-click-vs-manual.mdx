doc_type: explanation
---

SigNoz offers two ways to monitor your AWS infrastructure. This guide helps you choose the right approach.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | One-Click Integration | Manual Setup (OpenTelemetry) |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Availability** | SigNoz Cloud only | Cloud & Self-Hosted |
| **Setup Time** | ~5 minutes | 15-60 minutes per service |
| **Pre-built Dashboards** | ✅ Included | ❌ Build your own |
| **Auto-Discovery** | ✅ New resources detected automatically | ❌ Manual configuration |
| **AWS Cost** | CloudWatch + Firehose charges | Minimal (OpenTelemetry based) |
| **Granular Control** | Limited | Full control |
| **Best For** | Quick start, managed experience | Cost optimization, self-hosted |

## One-Click Integration

<Admonition type="info">
One-Click Integration is available for **SigNoz Cloud** users only.

### Get Started

See the [One-Click AWS Integrations Guide](https://signoz.io/docs/integrations/aws/one-click-aws-integrations/) for setup instructions.

### How It Works

1. **Connect AWS Account**: Deploy a CloudFormation stack that creates necessary IAM roles
2. **Auto-Discovery**: SigNoz automatically discovers your AWS resources
3. **CloudWatch Integration**: Metrics and logs are streamed via CloudWatch Metric Streams and Firehose
4. **Pre-built Dashboards**: Dashboards are automatically imported for each service

### AWS Cost Considerations

<Admonition type="warning">
One-Click integration incurs additional AWS charges beyond standard resource costs.

| Component | Pricing Model |
|-----------|--------------|
| CloudWatch Metric Streams | ~$0.003 per 1,000 metric updates |
| Kinesis Firehose | ~$0.03 per GB ingested |
| CloudWatch Logs (if enabled) | ~$0.50 per GB ingested (region & tier dependent) |

*Actual AWS bills depend heavily on number of metrics, resolution, enabled logs, and region.

## Manual Setup (OpenTelemetry)

### How It Works

Deploy OpenTelemetry Collectors to collect metrics and logs directly from your AWS resources. This approach works with both **SigNoz Cloud** and **Self-Hosted** deployments.

### Collection Methods

#### 1. OTel Collection Agents (Recommended for ECS/EKS)

Deploy collectors as sidecars or DaemonSets to collect infrastructure metrics and application telemetry.

- **ECS EC2**: [OTel Collector for ECS EC2](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/ecs/ec2/install/)
- **ECS Serverless**: [OTel Collector for ECS Serverless](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/ecs/sidecar/install/)
- **EKS/K8s**: [OTel Collector for K8s](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/k8s/k8s-infra/install-k8s-infra/)
- **EKS Fargate**: [OTel Collector for EKS Fargate](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/k8s/serverless/install/)

#### 2. CloudWatch Receiver (Logs Only)

Use the `awscloudwatch` receiver to poll for CloudWatch logs directly.

*Note: This receiver does not collect metrics.*

```yaml
receivers:
  awscloudwatch:
    region: us-east-1
    logs:
      poll_interval: 1m
      groups:
        named:
          /aws/lambda/my-function:
```

See [Send CloudWatch Logs to SigNoz](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/send-cloudwatch-logs-to-signoz/) for full configuration.

#### 3. S3 Lambda Forwarder (Log Files in S3)

For services that export logs to S3, deploy a Lambda function to forward logs to SigNoz.

See individual service docs for specific configurations:
- [ELB Logs](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/elb/)
- [VPC Flow Logs](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/vpc/)
- [RDS Logs](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/rds/)
- [S3 Access Logs](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/s3/)

#### 4. AWS Service Metrics (Manual via CloudWatch Exporter)

For AWS services where metrics are only available via CloudWatch (RDS, DynamoDB, Lambda, etc.), you can manually set up the **CloudWatch Exporter** if you are not using One-Click Metric Streams.

See the "Manual Setup" tab in each service guide for the specific YAML configuration:
- [API Gateway](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/api-gateway/)
- [DynamoDB](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/dynamodb/)
- [ElastiCache](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/elasticache/)
- [ELB Metrics](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/elb/)
- [Lambda](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/lambda/lambda-metrics/)
- [MSK](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/msk/)
- [RDS](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/rds/)
- [SQS](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/sqs/)
- [SNS](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/sns/)

#### 5. Lambda OTel Layers (Lambda Traces & Logs)

For AWS Lambda, use OpenTelemetry Lambda layers to auto-instrument your functions and send traces/logs directly to SigNoz.

**How it works:**
1. Add the language-specific OTel auto-instrumentation layer (Python, Node.js, Java, Ruby)
2. Add the OTel Collector layer to forward telemetry
3. Configure environment variables to point to SigNoz

```bash
# Example layer ARNs (replace <region> with your AWS region)
# Python auto-instrumentation
arn:aws:lambda:<region>:184161586896:layer:opentelemetry-python-0_11_0:1

# OTel Collector (x86_64)
arn:aws:lambda:<region>:184161586896:layer:opentelemetry-collector-amd64-0_12_0:1
```

See the detailed guides:
- [Lambda Logs](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/lambda/lambda-logs/) - S3-based log forwarding
- [Lambda Traces](https://signoz.io/docs/aws-monitoring/lambda/lambda-traces/) - OTel auto-instrumentation with layers

### AWS Cost Considerations

Manual setup minimizes AWS costs:

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| OTel Collector (EC2/ECS) | Compute cost only |
| CloudWatch Receiver | API calls (~$0.01 per 1,000 requests) |
| S3 Lambda Forwarder | Lambda invocations + S3 GET requests |

### When to Choose Manual

- You're using **Self-Hosted SigNoz**
- You need **fine-grained control** over what's collected
- You want to **minimize AWS costs**
- You need **custom processing** (filtering, transforming data)

## Hybrid Approach

You can combine both methods:

1. Use **One-Click** for critical services where pre-built dashboards save time
2. Use **Manual** for services where you need custom collection or cost control

The data from both methods flows into the same SigNoz instance and can be queried together.
