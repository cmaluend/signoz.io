### Q. How can I setup synthetic monitoring checks/alerts with SigNoz?
A. Currently synthetic monitoring is not supported in SigNoz. But you can use httpcheck to create HTTP-based health checks for your services. More details [here](https://signoz.io/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/).

### Q. Can I edit the subject of the alerts?
A. Yes, you can edit the subject of alerts for Slack, MS Teams, PagerDuty, and Opsgenie notification channels.
To edit the alert subject:
1. Navigate to **Settings**
2. Go to **Account Settings**
3. Select **Notification channel**
4. Click on the desired notification channel
