## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks critical performance metrics for your Grok usage using OpenTelemetry to help you:

- **Track Reliability**: Monitor error rates to identify reliability issues and ensure applications maintain a smooth, dependable experience.
- **Analyze Model Adoption**: Understand which Grok models are being used to track preferences and measure adoption of different models.
- **Monitor Usage Patterns**: Observe token consumption and request volume trends over time to spot adoption curves, peak cycles, and unusual spikes.
- **Ensure Responsiveness**: Track P95 latency to surface potential slowdowns, spikes, or regressions and maintain consistent user experience.
- **Understand Service Distribution**: See which services and programming languages are leveraging Grok across your stack.

## Metrics Included

### Token Usage Metrics

- **Total Token Usage (Input & Output)**: Displays the split between input tokens (user prompts) and output tokens (model responses), showing exactly how much work the system is doing over time.
- **Token Usage Over Time**: Time series visualization showing token consumption trends to identify adoption patterns, peak cycles, and baseline activity.

### Performance & Reliability

- **Total Error Rate**: Tracks the percentage of Grok calls that return errors, providing a quick way to identify reliability issues.
- **Latency (P95 Over Time)**: Measures the 95th percentile latency of requests over time to surface potential slowdowns and ensure consistent responsiveness.
- **Request Duration**: Monitors the duration of LLM requests from beginning to end.

### Usage Analysis

- **Model Distribution**: Shows which Grok model variants are being called, helping track preferences and measure adoption across different models.
- **Token Distribution by Model**: Shows the total token usage grouped by model to determine which model is using the most tokens.
- **Requests Over Time**: Captures the volume of requests sent to Grok over time, revealing demand patterns and high-traffic windows.
- **Services and Languages Using Grok**: Breakdown showing where Grok is being adopted across different services and programming languages in your stack.
- **Grok Logs**: Comprehensive list of all generated logs for Grok applications associated with the given service name.

### Error Tracking

- **Error Records**: Table logging all recorded errors with clickable records that link to the originating trace for detailed error investigation.
