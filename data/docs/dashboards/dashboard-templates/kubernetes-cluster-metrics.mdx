description: Monitor Kubernetes metrics for running pods for deployments, daemonsets, statefulset, replicasets and pods count by phase.
---

This dashboard provides an overview for the Kubernetes pods for deployments, daemonsets, statefulset, replicasets and pods count by phase using [`k8sclusterreceiver`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/k8sclusterreceiver/README.md).

<Admonition type="info">
  This dashboard requires K8s Infra to be installed and configured to collect cluster metrics. See
  the [K8s Infra installation
  guide](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/k8s/k8s-infra/install-k8s-infra/) to
  set up the data source.

## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks Kubernetes cluster metrics across different resource types:

### Pod Phase by Namespace

Shows the distribution of pods across different lifecycle phases (Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed, Unknown) grouped by namespace.

### Pod Replicas

Monitors Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) metrics including current replicas, desired replicas, minimum replicas, and maximum replicas.

### Deployments Available and Desired

Displays the number of available pods versus desired pods for each deployment.

### Jobs

Tracks job execution status showing active pods, successful pods, failed pods, and desired successful pods for each job.

### Daemonset Nodes

Monitors daemonset distribution across nodes, showing current scheduled nodes, desired scheduled nodes, and ready nodes.

### Statefulset Pods

Tracks statefulset health with metrics for current pods, desired pods, ready pods, and updated pods.

## Metrics Used

The dashboard utilizes these metrics from the k8sclusterreceiver:

- `k8s.pod.phase`: Pod lifecycle phase status

- `k8s.deployment.available`: Number of available deployment pods

- `k8s.deployment.desired`: Number of desired deployment pods

- `k8s.hpa.current_replicas`: Current HPA replica count

- `k8s.hpa.desired_replicas`: Desired HPA replica count

- `k8s.hpa.min_replicas`: Minimum HPA replicas

- `k8s.hpa.max_replicas`: Maximum HPA replicas

- `k8s.daemonset.current_scheduled_nodes`: Currently scheduled daemonset nodes

- `k8s.daemonset.desired_scheduled_nodes`: Desired daemonset nodes

- `k8s.daemonset.ready_nodes`: Ready daemonset nodes

- `k8s.statefulset.current_pods`: Current statefulset pods

- `k8s.statefulset.desired_pods`: Desired statefulset pods

- `k8s.statefulset.ready_pods`: Ready statefulset pods

- `k8s.statefulset.updated_pods`: Updated statefulset pods

- `k8s.job.active_pods`: Active job pods

- `k8s.job.successful_pods`: Successful job pods

- `k8s.job.failed_pods`: Failed job pods

- `k8s.job.desired_successful_pods`: Desired successful job pods

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes two template variables for filtering:

- `k8s.cluster.name`: Filter by specific Kubernetes cluster (single selection)

- `k8s.namespace.name`: Filter by one or multiple namespaces (multi-select enabled, defaults to "default")
