Gain complete transparency into your observability platform’s data consumption and cost drivers with the **Cost Meter** dashboard. This dashboard provides actionable, at-a-glance metrics for logs, spans, and metrics ingestion—helping you optimize costs, prevent overruns, and inform team or project-level budgeting.

## What This Dashboard Monitors

Cost Meter tracks fundamental observability usage metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Log, Trace, and Metrics Ingestion**: See real-time and historical ingestion rates and sizes for logs, spans, and metric datapoints.
- **Break Down Usage by Service and Environment**: Pinpoint services, environments that contribute most to data volumes and costs.
- **Analyze Trends Over Time**: Hourly/daily granularity enables trend analysis for spike detection, forecasting, and sustainable scale.

## Metrics Included

All metrics in this dashboard are derived from SigNoz Cost Meter, which exports standardized ingestion metrics with labels such as service, environment, host, and workspace key, enabling granular usage and cost breakdowns.
For complete details on Cost Meter metrics and implementation, refer to the [SigNoz Cost Meter documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/cost-meter/overview/).

### Log Metrics
- **Total Log Records Ingested** (`signoz.meter.log.count`)
- **Log Size Ingested (bytes)** (`signoz.meter.log.size`)

### Trace (Span) Metrics
- **Total Spans Ingested** (`signoz.meter.span.count`)
- **Spans Size Ingested (bytes)** (`signoz.meter.span.size`)

### Metrics Pipeline
- **Total Metric Datapoints Ingested** (`signoz.meter.metric.datapoint.count`)

### Cost Metering Labels

Each metric includes these labels for powerful breakdown and filtering:

- `service.name`
- `deployment.environment`
- `host.name`
- `signoz.workspace.key.id`

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes variables for flexible filtering, such as:

- **service.name**: Select one or more services
- **deployment.environment**: e.g., production, staging, dev
