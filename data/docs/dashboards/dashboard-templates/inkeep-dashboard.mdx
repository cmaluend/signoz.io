This dashboard offers a clear view into Inkeep usage and performance. It highlights key metrics such as model distribution, error rates, request volumes, and latency trends. Teams can also track detailed records of errors, to better understand adoption patterns and optimize reliability and efficiency.

## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks critical performance metrics for your Inkeep usage using OpenTelemetry to help you:

- **Track Reliability**: Monitor error rates to identify reliability issues and ensure applications maintain a smooth, dependable experience.
- **Analyze Model Adoption**: Understand which AI models (via providers like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, etc.) are being used through Inkeep to track preferences and measure adoption of different models.
- **Monitor Usage Patterns**: Observe token consumption and request volume trends over time to spot adoption curves, peak cycles, and unusual spikes.
- **Ensure Responsiveness**: Track P95 duration to surface potential slowdowns, spikes, or regressions and maintain consistent user experience.

## Metrics Included

### Token Usage Metrics

- **Total Token Usage (Input & Output)**: Displays the split between input tokens (user prompts) and output tokens (model responses), showing exactly how much work the system is doing over time.
- **Token Usage Over Time**: Time series visualization showing token consumption trends to identify adoption patterns, peak cycles, and baseline activity.

### Performance & Reliability

- **Total Error Rate**: Tracks the percentage of Inkeep calls that return errors, providing a quick way to identify reliability issues.
- **Duration (P95 Over Time)**: Measures the 95th percentile duration of requests over time to surface potential slowdowns and ensure consistent responsiveness.

### Usage Analysis

- **Model Distribution**: Shows which AI models from various providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, etc.) are being called through Inkeep, helping track preferences and measure adoption across different models.
- **Agent Distribution**: Shows which Agents are being used through Inkeep. 
- **Requests Over Time**: Captures the volume of requests sent to Inkeep over time, revealing demand patterns and high-traffic windows.
- **Agents**: List of agent calls along with how many times each agent was called and the average latency per agent. 

### Error Tracking

- **Error Records**: Table logging all recorded errors with clickable records that link to the originating trace for detailed error investigation.
