title: Supabase Monitoring Dashboard
description: Monitor Supabase, PgBouncer, and Postgres performance using OpenTelemetry.
doc_type: explanation
---

This dashboard provides monitoring for your Supabase projects, including insights into connection pooling (PgBouncer), database performance (Postgres), and system resource usage.

<Admonition type="info">
To use this dashboard, you need to configure Supabase to send metrics to SigNoz. Follow the [Supabase Integration](https://signoz.io/docs/integrations/supabase) guide to get started.

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **supabase_project_ref**: Filter by specific Supabase project ID
- **database**: Filter by database name
- **service.name**: Filter by specific service name
- **service_type**: Filter by service type (e.g., pgbouncer, postgres)

## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard provides visibility into:

- **Connection Health**: Track active, waiting, and idle connections in PgBouncer.
- **Database Throughput**: Monitor transactions, rows fetched/inserted, and cache hit ratios.
- **Resource Usage**: Keep tabs on CPU, memory, and disk usage for your database services.
- **Query Performance**: Analyze query execution times and identify potential bottlenecks like deadlocks.
- **Network Traffic**: Monitor ingress and egress traffic for database connections.

## Metrics Included

### Overview & Resources
- **Active DB Connections**: Current active client connections to database.
- **CPU Usage %**: Overall CPU utilization.
- **Memory Usage %**: Memory utilization percentage.
- **Disk Usage %**: Filesystem usage by mountpoint.
- **Network I/O**: Network receive and transmit rates.

### Connection Pool (PgBouncer)
- **Active Connections**: Active client connections by database.
- **Waiting Connections**: Clients waiting for server connection.
- **Server Connections (Idle)**: Idle server connections ready for queries.
- **Max Client Connections**: Maximum allowed client connections.
- **Client Wait Time**: Time clients spend waiting for server.
- **Connection Pool Efficiency**: Percentage of max connections in use.

### Database Performance
- **Transactions/sec**: Committed transactions per second.
- **Rows Fetched/Inserted**: Rate of rows fetched and inserted.
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: Percentage of queries served from cache.
- **Deadlocks**: Database deadlocks per second.
- **Database Size**: Database size breakdown.

### Query Performance
- **Query Execution Time**: Total query execution time per second.
- **Total Queries Executed**: Queries executed per second.
- **Average Query Duration**: Average query execution time in milliseconds.
- **Total User Queries**: Total queries from users.
- **Query Rate**: Queries per second pooled by PgBouncer.

### Detailed Resource Usage
- **CPU & Memory**: Detailed breakdown of CPU (user, system, wait) and memory usage.
- **Disk & Network**: I/O operations, throughput, and network traffic details.

### Logs & Traces
- **Logs**: Log volume and error logs trend.
- **Traces**: Application error rate, top error spans, and latency distribution.
