title: Go Runtime Metrics Dashboard
description: Monitor comprehensive Go runtime performance including memory usage, goroutine count, garbage collection, processor limits, and heap allocation for optimal Go application performance.
doc_type: explanation
---

This dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring of Go runtime performance and resource utilization, offering detailed visibility into memory usage, garbage collection, goroutine management, and heap allocation for optimal Go application monitoring.

<Admonition type="note">
To use this dashboard, you need to set up the data source and send telemetry to SigNoz. Follow the [Go Metrics](https://signoz.io/docs/metrics-management/send-metrics/applications/golang/) guide to get started.

## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential Go runtime metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Memory Usage**: Track heap and non-heap memory utilization
- **Track Garbage Collection**: Monitor GC frequency, duration, and heap size goals
- **Monitor Goroutines**: Track live goroutine counts for concurrency analysis
- **Analyze Memory Allocations**: Monitor allocation patterns and heap growth
- **Track Processor Limits**: Monitor available OS threads for Go code execution
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify memory leaks and optimize resource usage
- **Resource Management**: Monitor memory allocation efficiency and GC impact

## Metrics Included

### Memory Metrics
- **Memory Used**: Shows memory used by the Go runtime over time
- **Memory Allocated**: Shows memory allocated to the heap by the application over time
- **Memory Allocations**: Shows count of allocations to the heap over time
- **GC Heap Goal**: Shows heap size target for the end of the GC cycle over time

### Concurrency Metrics
- **Goroutine Count**: Shows count of live goroutines over time
- **Processor Limit**: Shows the number of OS threads that can execute user-level Go code simultaneously

### Configuration Metrics
- **GOGC Configuration**: Shows heap size target percentage configured by the user (default: 100)

### Derived Metrics
- **Memory Growth Rate**: Shows rate of memory allocation change over time
- **Goroutine Growth Rate**: Shows rate of goroutine creation over time
- **Allocation Rate**: Shows rate of heap allocations per second

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **service.name**: Filter by specific service name
