## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential database metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Database Performance**: Track database transaction rates and response times
- **Identify Top Database Operations**: Analyze the most frequently executed database statements
- **Track Database Errors**: Monitor database error rates and identify problematic queries
- **Optimize Slow Queries**: Identify and analyze the slowest database calls for optimization
- **Database Health Monitoring**: Keep track of overall database system health and performance

## Metrics Included

### Transaction Rate Metrics
- **DB Transaction Rate**: Shows database transaction rate over time (req/s)

### Error Metrics
- **DB Error Rate**: Shows database error percentage over time

### Top Operations
- **Top DB Statements Table**: Shows database statements with dbName, db.statement, total calls, average duration, and rate

### Slowest DB Calls
- **Slowest DB Calls Table**: Shows slowest database operations with timestamp, serviceName, name, durationNano, db.statement, and dbOperation

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **service.name**: Filter by specific service names making database calls
