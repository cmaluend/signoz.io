## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks critical performance metrics for your Autogen usage using OpenTelemetry to help you:

- **Track Reliability**: Monitor error rates to identify reliability issues and ensure applications maintain a smooth, dependable experience.
- **Analyze Model Adoption**: Understand which Autogen model variants are being used most often to track preferences and measure adoption of newer releases.
- **Monitor Usage Patterns**: Observe token consumption and request volume trends over time to spot adoption curves, peak cycles, and unusual spikes.
- **Ensure Responsiveness**: Track P95 latency to surface potential slowdowns, spikes, or regressions and maintain consistent user experience.
- **Understand Service Distribution**: See which services and programming languages are leveraging Autogen across your stack.

## Metrics Included

### Performance & Reliability

- **Total Error Rate**: Tracks the percentage of Autogen calls that return errors, providing a quick way to identify reliability issues.
- **Latency (P95 Over Time)**: Measures the 95th percentile latency of requests over time to surface potential slowdowns and ensure consistent responsiveness.
- **HTTP Request Duration**: Monitors the duration of outbound HTTP requests made during LLM calls, helping identify network bottlenecks and API response time patterns that impact overall Autogen performance.

### Usage Analysis

- **Model Distribution**: Shows which Autogen model variants are being called most often, helping track preferences and measure adoption across different models.
- **Requests Over Time**: Captures the volume of requests sent to Autogen over time, revealing demand patterns and high-traffic windows.
- **Services and Languages Using Autogen**: Breakdown showing where Autogen is being adopted across different services and programming languages in your stack.
- **Agents**: List of agents along with how many times each agent was called.
- **Tools**: List of tool calls along with how many times each tool was called.
- **Autogen Request Logs**: Comprehensive list of all generated logs for Autogen requests associated with the given service name, providing detailed visibility into API call patterns.

### Error Tracking

- **Error Records**: Table logging all recorded errors with clickable records that link to the originating trace for detailed error investigation.
