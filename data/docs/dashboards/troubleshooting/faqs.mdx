### Q. I see an empty Dashboard, what should I do ?
A. Try changing the variable in the Dashboard. Or increase the time range to see if data is available.

Try changing the variable in Dashboard. 
For example, if you're using the **[Kubernetes Pod Metrics - Overall](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/k8s-infra-metrics/kubernetes-pod-metrics-overall.json)** dashboard, you can select $node_name variable as **ALL** to see the data as shown in below image.

### Q. Is it possible to import Grafana Dashboards in SigNoz?
A. No, it's not possible to import Grafana Dashboards in SigNoz at the moment.

### Q. How do I change legend colors in charts?
A. You can change the legend colors in charts by modifying the chart settings. Look for the "Legend Colors" option in the chart settings panel, where you can customize the colors for each series in the chart.

<details>
<summary> Show detailed steps </summary>
To change legend colors:
1. Go in edit panel mode
2. Locate the right side panel of your chart
3. Find the "Legend Colors" option
4. Select and adjust the colors for individual legend items as needed
This is particularly useful when certain color combinations may be difficult to read, such as when hovering over data points with default color schemes.

### Q. How do I export table data to CSV from dashboards?
A. You can download table data as CSV directly from the dashboard view. Follow these steps:

<details>

<summary> Show detailed steps </summary>

1. Create and configure your table in the dashboard editor.  
2. Save the dashboard.  
3. Open the saved dashboard in view mode.  
4. In the table panel, locate the menu icon (three vertical dots) and select "Download CSV" to export the table data.

</details>

Note: The CSV download option is only available in the dashboard view mode, not in the dashboard editor mode.

### Q. Why do my time series and bar charts show 'no data' even though my table view displays results?

A. Time series and bar charts require a timestamp column in your query results to plot data correctly. These chart types use time as the x-axis, so without a timestamp column, they cannot display the data even if your table view shows results.

<details>

<summary> Show detailed steps to resolve </summary>

To resolve this issue:

1. **Add a timestamp column to your SELECT statement**
   - Your query must include a column that represents time/date values

2. **Ensure the timestamp column is properly formatted**
   - The timestamp should be in a format that the charting system can recognize

3. **Verify your GROUP BY clause includes time-based grouping**
   - For time series charts, you typically need to group your data by time intervals

**Example:**

If you have a query like `max(last_seen) AS bucket_completed` which contains timestamp data, you may need to adjust how this is structured or ensure it's being recognized as the time dimension for your charts.

**Alternative visualization:**

If you only need to display aggregate data without time-based visualization, consider using a table view or other chart types that don't require time-based x-axis data.

### Q. Why do my custom rate queries differ from the Services dashboard?

If you're trying to recreate the rate metrics shown in the Services dashboard using custom queries in the Metrics section, you may notice that your numbers don't match. This is because the Services dashboard has specific filtering that affects the calculations.

<details>

<summary>Show detailed explanation</summary>

**Understanding the difference**

The rate table under Services only considers **top-level operations**, which is why there's a discrepancy between what you see in the Services dashboard and what you get when querying `signoz_calls_total` directly with Rate and Sum functions.

When you query `signoz_calls_total` in the Metrics section, you're getting data from all operations, including nested or child operations. However, the Services dashboard filters this data to show only top-level operations, resulting in different (typically lower) values.

**Getting accurate Service-level metrics**

To recreate the same metrics you see in the Services dashboard, you'll need to use queries that filter for top-level operations only.

For reference queries and examples, you can import the official [APM Metrics dashboard template](/docs/dashboards/dashboard-templates/apm-metrics) from the SigNoz documentation. This will provide you with the proper query structure to match the Services dashboard calculations.

For more information about how APM metrics are generated from span data, see [Guide to APM metrics](/docs/traces-management/guides/apm-metrics).
