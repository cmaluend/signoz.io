Try changing the variable in Dashboard. 
For example, if you're using the **[Kubernetes Pod Metrics - Overall](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/k8s-infra-metrics/kubernetes-pod-metrics-overall.json)** dashboard, you can select $node_name variable as **ALL** to see the data as shown in below image.

### Q. Why is my formula query (A/B) not showing any data?

A. When using formula queries like `A/B` in dashboards, the most common reason for missing data is mismatched timestamps and label sets between the queries.

<details>

<summary> Show detailed explanation and solution </summary>

**Common Issue: Mismatched timestamps and label sets**

For a formula like `A/B` to work, both queries A and B must have:
- Matching timestamps
- Matching label sets

If your queries A and B have different filter conditions (especially different states or grouping labels), there may be no common label set to evaluate the formula against, resulting in no data.

**To resolve this issue:**

1. **Set the correct aggregation interval**: If you're reporting metrics at 5-minute intervals, manually set the aggregation interval to 300 seconds instead of leaving it on auto.

2. **Ensure compatible label sets**: Make sure your queries A and B can produce data points with matching timestamps and label combinations. If they have different filter conditions that prevent overlap, consider adjusting your queries to have compatible label sets.

3. **Check for zero or near-zero values**: While near-zero values shouldn't prevent formula evaluation, ensure your data contains the expected values for both queries.
