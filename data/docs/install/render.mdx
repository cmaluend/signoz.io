This guide explains how to deploy SigNoz on <a href="https://render.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Render</a> using <a href="https://github.com/SigNoz/foundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Foundry</a>. Foundry generates a [Render Blueprint](https://render.com/docs/blueprint-spec) (infrastructure-as-code YAML) from your casting, which you then connect to your Render account.

## Prerequisites

- A <a href="https://render.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Render</a> account.
- **foundryctl**: The Foundry CLI (see Step 1).
- A **Git repository** connected to Render (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). The generated Blueprint and configs will be committed and pushed so Render can deploy from the repo.

## Step 1. Install foundryctl

Download and extract the `foundryctl` binary from <a href="https://github.com/SigNoz/foundry/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GitHub Releases</a>.

**Linux:**

```bash
curl -L "https://github.com/SigNoz/foundry/releases/download/{version}/foundry_linux_$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/g' | sed 's/aarch64/arm64/g').tar.gz" -o foundry.tar.gz
tar -xzf foundry.tar.gz
```

**macOS:**

```bash
curl -L "https://github.com/SigNoz/foundry/releases/download/{version}/foundry_darwin_$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/g' | sed 's/arm64/arm64/g').tar.gz" -o foundry.tar.gz
tar -xzf foundry.tar.gz
```

- Replace `{version}` with the latest release from [Foundry releases](https://github.com/SigNoz/foundry/releases).

Run `foundryctl` from the unpacked directory (e.g. `./foundry/bin/foundryctl`) or add that directory to your `PATH`.

## Step 2. Create casting.yaml

Create a casting file that targets Render with `flavor: blueprint` and `platform: render`. Set `metadata.name` to a deployment name of your choice.

For a minimal Render example, see the <a href="https://github.com/SigNoz/foundry/tree/main/docs/examples/render/blueprint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Foundry Render blueprint example</a>.
</Admonition>

```yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: {deployment-name}
spec:
  deployment:
    flavor: blueprint
    platform: render
```

- Replace `{deployment-name}` with your deployment name (e.g. signoz).

## Step 3. Generate the Blueprint (forge)

For Render, Foundry does not deploy for you. You must run **forge** to generate the Render Blueprint and configs:

```bash
foundryctl forge -f casting.yaml
```

Foundry writes the generated files (including `render.yaml`) into the `pours/` directory. If you run `foundryctl cast` with a Render casting, it only prints a reminder to run forge and then deploy `render.yaml` to Render using <a href="https://render.com/docs/infrastructure-as-code#setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Render's Infrastructure as Code</a>.

## Step 4. Deploy on Render

Deploy the generated Blueprint using Render's IaC flow:

1. **Commit and push** the contents of `pours/` (including `render.yaml`) to a Git repository that Render can access.
2. Follow <a href="https://render.com/docs/infrastructure-as-code#setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Render's Infrastructure as Code setup</a>: in the <a href="https://dashboard.render.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Render Dashboard</a>, go to **New &gt; Blueprint**, connect your repository, and point Render to the Blueprint file (e.g. `pours/render.yaml`).
3. **Review** the services and resources Render will create, then deploy the Blueprint.

Render will provision and run the SigNoz services (SigNoz, ClickHouse, OTel Collector, etc.) as defined in the Blueprint. When deployment finishes, use the URL Render assigns to the SigNoz web service to access the UI.

## Verify the deployment

In the Render Dashboard, confirm that all services from the Blueprint are running. Open the SigNoz web service URL and check the health endpoint if needed:

```bash
curl -X GET https://{your-signoz-service}.onrender.com/api/v1/health
```

- Replace `{your-signoz-service}` with the actual hostname Render gives your SigNoz web service.

## Troubleshooting

- **Blueprint fails to apply**: Check that the Blueprint YAML in `pours/` is valid and that all required fields (e.g. `type`, `name`, `runtime`) are present. See the [Render Blueprint spec](https://render.com/docs/blueprint-spec).
- **Services not starting**: In the Render Dashboard, open the logs for each service. Ensure environment variables and service links (e.g. database URLs) match what Foundry generated.
