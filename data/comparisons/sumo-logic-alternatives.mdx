Sumo Logic was founded in 2010 as a cloud-native log management solution and has since evolved into a comprehensive platform covering observability, security analytics, and SIEM capabilities. Organisations use it to ingest data from hundreds of sources in real time, leverage machine learning for anomaly and threat detection, and support use cases ranging from rapid troubleshooting to compliance audits through automated alert triaging and integrated dashboards.

For cloud-heavy setups or security-focused operations, these capabilities shine, giving you fast insights without much upfront hassle. However, as your data scales up, things can get tricky, like costs rising sharply with volume-based pricing, the custom query language has a bit of a learning curve that slows down newcomers, and the UI can lag when you're querying large datasets or dealing with error codes.
