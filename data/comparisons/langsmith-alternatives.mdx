LangSmith by LangChain is a unified platform for developing, collaborating, testing, deploying, and monitoring LLM applications. Teams turn to it primarily for its tracing capabilities that make complex agent chains visible and debuggable, along with evaluation frameworks for testing prompts and a safe playground for experimentation. For teams already invested in LangChain, it's a natural starting point that delivers value quickly.

For early-stage projects or teams deeply embedded in the LangChain ecosystem, these features deliver solid value without requiring much setup. However, scaling reveals some friction points. Per-trace pricing climbs quickly as your production traffic grows, making costs harder to predict and manage. The tight coupling with LangChain becomes restrictive when you want to experiment with other frameworks or adopt a multi-framework architecture. Self-hosting exists as an alternative, but comes with data retention constraints and integration challenges that demand additional engineering effort to work around.
