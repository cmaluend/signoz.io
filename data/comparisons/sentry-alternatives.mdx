Error tracking ensures that software failures do not degrade the user experience or lead to customer churn. While Sentry remains a powerful tool for catching code-level bugs, it often lacks the context required for debugging complex, distributed environments. As applications move toward microservices and serverless architectures, the line between error tracking and full-stack observability has blurred. Teams are finding that Sentry's focus on stack traces isn't enough, they need to correlate exceptions with logs, metrics, and traces to understand the root cause of failures across their entire infrastructure.


## Why Teams are Moving Away from Sentry

Sentry has evolved from a lightweight error tracker into a complex observability platform. While this expansion added features like Session Replay and Cron Monitoring, it also introduced operational overhead and pricing friction that many teams find difficult to manage.

### Data Sovereignty and AI Training


<Figure

  caption="Sentry TOS updates"
/>


In 2024, Sentry updated its Terms of Service to include rights for using "Service Data" for product development, which includes AI model training. Although the company later clarified that identifying data requires explicit authorization, the initial lack of transparency caused concern in regulated sectors like healthcare or finance, where any ambiguity in data usage rights is a significant risk. 


### Pricing Volatility and Budget Complexity

Sentry uses a volume-based pricing model where you pay for every captured event. During a cascading failure, an application might generate millions of exceptions in minutes. This can result in massive billing spikes unless you've configured quotas/rate limits, Spike Protection, or aggressive inbound filters. 

### The Operational Burden of Self-Hosting

While Sentry is "Fair Source," self-hosting the modern stack is no longer a simple task. A standard installation now runs dozens of services/containers (Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse/Snuba, Relay, Symbolicator, web/worker/cron, etc.), creating a distributed architecture that becomes difficult to maintain at scale.

  alt="MemoryError captured as an exception when the process runs out of memory in SigNoz"
  caption="MemoryError captured as an exception when the process runs out of memory in SigNoz"
/>


SigNoz is a unified observability platform. Unlike Sentry, which often feels like several disparate tools stitched together, SigNoz uses a single, unified data model for logs, metrics, and traces. It is built natively on [OpenTelemetry (OTel)](https://signoz.io/blog/what-is-opentelemetry/), the industry standard for vendor-neutral instrumentation.

**Technical Architecture**

SigNoz uses ClickHouse as its primary storage engine. ClickHouse is a columnar database designed for OLAP workloads, which makes it far more efficient than PostgreSQL for high-cardinality telemetry (data with many unique attribute combinations, like user IDs or trace IDs). This allows SigNoz to perform complex queries across billions of rows without the latency issues that plague Sentry's Snuba layer in self-hosted environments. Because it follows the OTel standard, you do not need proprietary SDKs to send data.

**Core Capabilities**
- **Native OTel Integration:** You instrument once with OpenTelemetry and can send data to SigNoz or any other OTel-compliant backend without changing your code.
- **Correlated Telemetry:** When an exception is logged, SigNoz automatically links it to the specific trace span. This allows you to see the database query, the downstream API call, and the host metrics at the exact millisecond of the failure.
- **Custom Dashboards:** Use the advanced query builder to create visualizations for business-critical metrics, such as error rates segmented by specific customer subscription tiers or geographical regions.


### Comparison to Sentry

Sentry and SigNoz overlap in functionality, but they are optimized for different engineering objectives. Sentry is popularly used for developer-first error monitoring, offering deep breadcrumbs, stack traces, and session replays that simplify frontend and mobile debugging. It is the better choice if your primary pain point is triaging exceptions and managing release health. 

In contrast, SigNoz is built for full-stack observability using an OpenTelemetry-native foundation. It is designed for teams that need to analyze traces, metrics, and logs together to debug system-wide performance and distributed microservices. SigNoz offers lower and more predictable costs compared to Sentry by moving away from per-event pricing and focusing on transparent per-GB data ingestion pricing. 

In a modern production environment, many teams use both tools together to gain complete coverage. Sentry often handles frontend error triage and user experience monitoring, while SigNoz provides the end-to-end observability required for backend service correlation and infrastructure debugging.
